<h2>PROLOGUE: THE OLYMPIANS</h2>


<p class="drop-cap">LOOKING back to those days of old, ere
the gate shut to behind me, I can see
now that to children with a proper equipment
of parents these things would have worn a different
aspect. But to those whose nearest were
aunts and uncles, a special attitude of mind may
be allowed. They treated us, indeed, with kindness
enough as to the needs of the flesh, but
after that with indifference (an indifference, as
I recognise, the result of a certain stupidity),
and therewith the commonplace conviction that
your child is merely animal. At a very early
age I remember realising in a quite impersonal
and kindly way the existence of that stupidity,
and its tremendous influence in the world; while
there grew up in me, as in the parallel case of
Caliban upon Setebos, a vague sense of a ruling
power, wilful, and freakish, and prone to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
practice of vagaries—‘just choosing so’: as,
for instance, the giving of authority over us to
these hopeless and incapable creatures, when
it might far more reasonably have been given
to ourselves over them. These elders, our betters
by a trick of chance, commanded no respect,
but only a certain blend of envy—of their good
luck—and pity—for their inability to make
use of it. Indeed, it was one of the most
hopeless features in their character (when we
troubled ourselves to waste a thought on them:
which wasn’t often) that, having absolute licence
to indulge in the pleasures of life, they could
get no good of it. They might dabble in the
pond all day, hunt the chickens, climb trees in
the most uncompromising Sunday clothes; they
were free to issue forth and buy gunpowder in
the full eye of the sun—free to fire cannons and
explode mines on the lawn: yet they never did
any one of these things. No irresistible Energy
haled them to church o’ Sundays; yet they
went there regularly of their own accord, though
they betrayed no greater delight in the experience
than ourselves.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span></p>

<p>On the whole, the existence of these Olympians
seemed to be entirely void of interests,
even as their movements were confined and
slow, and their habits stereotyped and senseless.
To anything but appearances they were blind.
For them the orchard (a place elf-haunted,
wonderful!) simply produced so many apples
and cherries: or it didn’t—when the failures of
Nature were not infrequently ascribed to us.
They never set foot within fir-wood or hazel-copse,
nor dreamt of the marvels hid therein.
The mysterious sources, sources as of old Nile,
that fed the duck-pond had no magic for them.
They were unaware of Indians, nor recked they
anything of bisons or of pirates (with pistols!),
though the whole place swarmed with such
portents. They cared not to explore for robbers’
caves, nor dig for hidden treasure. Perhaps,
indeed, it was one of their best qualities
that they spent the greater part of their time
stuffily indoors.</p>

<p>To be sure there was an exception in the
curate, who would receive, unblenching, the information
that the meadow beyond the orchard<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
was a prairie studded with herds of buffalo, which
it was our delight, moccasined and tomahawked,
to ride down with those whoops that announce
the scenting of blood. He neither laughed nor
sneered, as the Olympians would have done;
but, possessed of a serious idiosyncrasy, he
would contribute such lots of valuable suggestion
as to the pursuit of this particular sort of
big game that, as it seemed to us, his mature
age and eminent position could scarce have been
attained without a practical knowledge of the
creature in its native lair. Then, too, he was
always ready to constitute himself a hostile army
or a band of marauding Indians on the shortest
possible notice: in brief, a distinctly able man,
with talents, so far as we could judge, immensely
above the majority. I trust he is a bishop by
this time. He had all the necessary qualifications,
as we knew.</p>

<p>These strange folk had visitors sometimes—stiff
and colourless Olympians like themselves,
equally without vital interests and intelligent
pursuits: emerging out of the clouds, and
passing away again to drag on an aimless<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
existence somewhere beyond our ken. Then
brute force was pitilessly applied. We were
captured, washed, and forced into clean collars:
silently submitting as was our wont, with more
contempt than anger. Anon, with unctuous hair
and faces stiffened in a conventional grin, we
sat and listened to the usual platitudes. How
could reasonable people spend their precious
time so? That was ever our wonder as we
bounded forth at last: to the old clay-pit to
make pots, or to hunt bears among the hazels.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;">

<div class="caption">“.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. HE WAS ALWAYS READY TO CONSTITUTE HIMSELF<br>
A HOSTILE ARMY OR A BAND OF MARAUDING INDIANS”</div>
</div>

<p>It was perennial matter for amazement how
these Olympians would talk over our heads—during
meals, for instance—of this or the other
social or political inanity, under the delusion
that these pale phantasms of reality were
among the importances of life. We <i>illuminati</i>,
eating silently, our heads full of plans and conspiracies,
could have told them what real life
was. We had just left it outside, and were all
on fire to get back to it. Of course we didn’t
waste the revelation on them, the futility of
imparting our ideas had long been demonstrated.
One in thought and purpose, linked<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
by the necessity of combating one hostile fate,
a power antagonistic ever—a power we lived to
evade—we had no confidants save ourselves.
This strange anæmic order of beings was further
removed from us, in fact, than the kindly beasts
who shared our natural existence in the sun.
The estrangement was fortified by an abiding
sense of injustice, arising from the refusal of the
Olympians ever to defend, to retract, to admit
themselves in the wrong, or to accept similar
concessions on our part. For instance, when I
flung the cat out of an upper window (though I
did it from no ill-feeling, and it didn’t hurt the
cat), I was ready, after a moment’s reflection,
to own I was wrong, as a gentleman should.
But was the matter allowed to end there? I
trow not. Again, when Harold was locked up
in his room all day, for assault and battery
upon a neighbour’s pig—an action he would
have scorned: being indeed on the friendliest
terms with the porker in question—there was
no handsome expression of regret on the discovery
of the real culprit. What Harold had
felt was not so much the imprisonment—indeed,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
he had very soon escaped by the window, with
assistance from his allies, and had only gone
back in time for his release—as the Olympian
habit. A word would have set all right; but of
course that word was never spoken.</p>

<p>Well! The Olympians are all past and gone.
Somehow the sun does not seem to shine so
brightly as it used; the trackless meadows of
old time have shrunk and dwindled away to a
few poor acres. A saddening doubt, a dull
suspicion, creeps over me. <i>Et in Arcadia ego</i>—I
certainly did once inhabit Arcady. Can it
be that I also have become an Olympian?</p>

<h2>A HOLIDAY</h2>


<p class="drop-cap">THE masterful wind was up and out, shouting
and chasing, the lord of the morning.
Poplars swayed and tossed with a roaring
swish; dead leaves sprang aloft, and whirled
into space; and all the clear-swept heaven
seemed to thrill with sound like a great harp.
It was one of the first awakenings of the year.
The earth stretched herself, smiling in her
sleep; and everything leapt and pulsed to the
stir of the giant’s movement. With us it was
a whole holiday; the occasion a birthday—it
matters not whose. Some one of us had had
presents, and pretty conventional speeches, and
had glowed with that sense of heroism which
is no less sweet that nothing has been done to
deserve it. But the holiday was for all, the
rapture of awakening Nature for all, the various
outdoor joys of puddles and sun and hedge-breaking<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
for all. Colt-like I ran through the
meadows, frisking happy heels in the face of
Nature laughing responsive. Above, the sky
was bluest of the blue; wide pools left by the
winter’s floods flashed the colour back, true and
brilliant; and the soft air thrilled with the germinating
touch that seems to kindle something
in my own small person as well as in the rash
primrose already lurking in sheltered haunts.
Out into the brimming sun-bathed world I sped,
free of lessons, free of discipline and correction,
for one day at least. My legs ran of themselves,
and though I heard my name called faint and
shrill behind, there was no stopping for me. It
was only Harold, I concluded, and his legs,
though shorter than mine, were good for a
longer spurt than this. Then I heard it called
again, but this time more faintly, with a pathetic
break in the middle; and I pulled up short,
recognising Charlotte’s plaintive note.</p>

<p>She panted up anon, and dropped on the turf
beside me. Neither had any desire for talk;
the glow and the glory of existing on this perfect
morning were satisfaction full and sufficient.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span></p>

<p>‘Where’s Harold?’ I asked presently.</p>

<p>‘Oh, he’s just playin’ muffin-man, as usual,’
said Charlotte with petulance. ‘Fancy wanting
to be a muffin-man on a whole holiday!’</p>

<p>It was a strange craze, certainly; but Harold,
who invented his own games and played them
without assistance, always stuck staunchly to a
new fad, till he had worn it quite out. Just at
present he was a muffin-man, and day and night
he went through passages and up and down
staircases, ringing a noiseless bell and offering
phantom muffins to invisible wayfarers. It
sounds a poor sort of sport; and yet—to pass
along busy streets of your own building, for
ever ringing an imaginary bell and offering
airy muffins of your own make to a bustling
thronging crowd of your own creation—there
were points about the game, it cannot be denied,
though it seemed scarce in harmony with this
radiant wind-swept morning!</p>

<p>‘And Edward, where is he?’ I questioned
again.</p>

<p>‘He’s coming along by the road,’ said Charlotte.
‘He’ll be crouching in the ditch when<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
we get there, and he’s going to be a grizzly
bear and spring out on us, only you mustn’t
say I told you, ’cos it’s to be a surprise.’</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 499px;">
<img src="The%20Project%20Gutenberg%20eBook%20of%20The%20Golden%20Age,%20by%20Kenneth%20Grahame_files/illus029.jpg" alt="boy outside garden walking with board on his head" height="701" width="499">
<div class="caption">“‘WHERE’S HAROLD?’ I ASKED PRESENTLY. ‘OH,<br>
HE’S JUST PLAYIN’ MUFFIN-MAN AS USUAL.’”</div>
</div>

<p>‘All right,’ I said magnanimously. ‘Come
on and let’s be surprised.’ But I could not
help feeling that on this day of days even a
grizzly felt misplaced and common.</p>

<p>Sure enough an undeniable bear sprang out
on us as we dropped into the road; then
ensued shrieks, growlings, revolver-shots, and
unrecorded heroisms, till Edward condescended
at last to roll over and die, bulking large and
grim, an unmitigated grizzly. It was an understood
thing, that whoever took upon himself to
be a bear must eventually die, sooner or later,
even if he were the eldest born; else, life would
have been all strife and carnage, and the Age of
Acorns have displaced our hard-won civilisation.
This little affair concluded with satisfaction to all
parties concerned, we rambled along the road,
picking up the defaulting Harold by the way,
muffinless now and in his right and social mind.</p>

<p>‘What would you do?’ asked Charlotte
presently—the book of the moment always<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
dominating her thoughts until it was sucked
dry and cast aside,—‘What would you do if
you saw two lions in the road, one on each
side, and you didn’t know if they was loose
or if they was chained up?’</p>

<p>‘Do?’ shouted Edward valiantly, ‘I should—I
should—I should—’ His boastful accents
died away into a mumble: ‘Dunno what I
should do.’</p>

<p>‘Shouldn’t do anything,’ I observed after
consideration; and, really, it would be difficult
to arrive at a wiser conclusion.</p>

<p>‘If it came to <i>doing</i>,’ remarked Harold reflectively,
‘the lions would do all the doing there
was to do, wouldn’t they?’</p>

<p>‘But if they was <i>good</i> lions,’ rejoined Charlotte,
‘they would do as they would be done by.’</p>

<p>‘Ah, but how are you to know a good lion
from a bad one?’ said Edward. ‘The books
don’t tell you at all, and the lions ain’t marked
any different.’</p>

<p>‘Why, there aren’t any good lions,’ said
Harold hastily.</p>

<p>‘O yes, there are, heaps and heaps,’ contradicted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
Edward. ‘Nearly all the lions in
the story-books are good lions. There was
Androcles’ lion, and St. Jerome’s lion, and—and—and
the Lion and the Unicorn——’</p>

<p>‘He beat the Unicorn,’ observed Harold
dubiously, ‘all round the town.’</p>

<p>‘That <i>proves</i> he was a good lion,’ cried
Edward triumphantly. ‘But the question is,
how are you to tell ’em when you see ’em?’</p>

<p>‘<i>I</i> should ask Martha,’ said Harold of the
simple creed.</p>

<p>Edward snorted contemptuously, then turned
to Charlotte. ‘Look here,’ he said; ‘let’s play
at lions, anyhow, and I’ll run on to that corner
and be a lion,—I’ll be two lions, one on each
side of the road,—and you’ll come along, and
you won’t know whether I’m chained up or not,
and that’ll be the fun!’</p>

<p>‘No, thank you,’ said Charlotte firmly;
‘you’ll be chained up till I’m quite close to
you, and then you’ll be loose, and you’ll tear
me in pieces, and make my frock all dirty, and
p’raps you’ll hurt me as well. <i>I</i> know your
lions!’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span></p>

<p>‘No, I won’t, I swear I won’t,’ protested
Edward. ‘I’ll be quite a new lion this time—something
you can’t even imagine.’ And he
raced off to his post. Charlotte hesitated—then
she went timidly on, at each step growing
less Charlotte, the mummer of a minute,
and more the anxious Pilgrim of all time. The
lion’s wrath waxed terrible at her approach;
his roaring filled the startled air. I waited
until they were both thoroughly absorbed, and
then I slipped through the hedge out of the
trodden highway, into the vacant meadow
spaces. It was not that I was unsociable, nor
that I knew Edward’s lions to the point of
satiety; but the passion and the call of the
divine morning were high in my blood. Earth
to earth! That was the frank note, the joyous
summons of the day; and they could not but jar
and seem artificial, these human discussions and
pretences, when boon nature, reticent no more,
was singing that full-throated song of hers that
thrills and claims control of every fibre. The
air was wine, the moist earth-smell wine, the
lark’s song, the wafts from the cow-shed at top<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
of the field, the pant and smoke of a distant train—all
were wine—or song, was it? or odour,
this unity they all blent into? I had no words
then to describe it, that earth-effluence of which
I was so conscious; nor, indeed, have I found
words since. I ran sideways, shouting; I dug
glad heels into the squelching soil; I splashed
diamond showers from puddles with a stick; I
hurled clods skywards at random, and presently
I somehow found myself singing. The words
were mere nonsense—irresponsible babble; the
tune was an improvisation, a weary, unrhythmic
thing of rise and fall: and yet it seemed to me
a genuine utterance, and just at that moment
the one thing fitting and right and perfect.
Humanity would have rejected it with scorn.
Nature, everywhere singing in the same key,
recognised and accepted it without a flicker of
dissent.</p>

<p>All the time the hearty wind was calling to
me companionably from where he swung and
bellowed in the tree-tops. ‘Take me for guide
to-day,’ he seemed to plead. ‘Other holidays
you have tramped it in the track of the stolid,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
unswerving sun; a belated truant, you have
dragged a weary foot homeward with only a
pale, expressionless moon for company. To-day
why not I, the trickster, the hypocrite? I
who whip round corners and bluster, relapse
and evade, then rally and pursue! I can lead
you the best and rarest dance of any; for I
am the strong capricious one, the lord of misrule,
and I alone am irresponsible and unprincipled,
and obey no law.’ And for me, I was
ready enough to fall in with the fellow’s humour;
was not this a whole holiday? So we
sheered off together, arm-in-arm, so to speak;
and with fullest confidence I took the jigging,
thwartwise course my chainless pilot laid for
me.</p>

<p>A whimsical comrade I found him, ere he had
done with me. Was it in jest, or with some
serious purpose of his own, that he brought me
plump upon a pair of lovers, silent, face to face
o’er a discreet unwinking stile? As a rule this
sort of thing struck me as the most pitiful tomfoolery.
Two calves rubbing noses through a
gate were natural and right and within the order<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
of things; but that human beings, with salient
interests and active pursuits beckoning them on
from every side, could thus—! Well, it was a
thing to hurry past, shamed of face, and think
on no more. But this morning everything I met
seemed to be accounted for and set in tune by
that same magical touch in the air; and it was
with a certain surprise that I found myself regarding
these fatuous ones with kindliness instead
of contempt, as I rambled by, unheeded of
them. There was indeed some reconciling influence
abroad, which could bring the like antics
into harmony with bud and growth and the frolic
air.</p>

<p>A puff on the right cheek from my wilful companion
sent me off at a fresh angle, and presently
I came in sight of the village church,
sitting solitary within its circle of elms. From
forth the vestry window projected two small
legs, gyrating, hungry for foothold, with larceny—not
to say sacrilege—in their every wriggle:
a godless sight for a supporter of the Establishment.
Though the rest was hidden, I knew the
legs well enough; they were usually attached<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
to the body of Bill Saunders, the peerless bad
boy of the village. Bill’s coveted booty, too,
I could easily guess at that; it came from the
Vicar’s store of biscuits, kept (as I knew) in
a cupboard along with his official trappings.
For a moment I hesitated; then I passed on
my way. I protest I was not on Bill’s side;
but then, neither was I on the Vicar’s, and
there was something in this immoral morning
which seemed to say that perhaps, after all,
Bill had as much right to the biscuits as the
Vicar, and would certainly enjoy them better;
and anyhow it was a disputable point, and no
business of mine. Nature, who had accepted
me for ally, cared little who had the world’s
biscuits, and assuredly was not going to let
any friend of hers waste his time in playing
policeman for Society.</p>

<p>He was tugging at me anew, my insistent
guide; and I felt sure, as I rambled off in his
wake, that he had more holiday matter to show
me. And so, indeed, he had; and all of it
was to the same lawless tune. Like a black
pirate flag on the blue ocean of air, a hawk<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
hung ominous; then, plummet-wise, dropped to
the hedgerow, whence there rose, thin and shrill,
a piteous voice of squealing. By the time I got
there a whisk of feathers on the turf—like
scattered playbills—was all that remained to
tell of the tragedy just enacted. Yet Nature
smiled and sang on, pitiless, gay, impartial. To
her, who took no sides, there was every bit as
much to be said for the hawk as for the chaffinch.
Both were her children, and she would
show no preferences.</p>

<p>Further on, a hedgehog lay dead athwart
the path—nay, more than dead; decadent, distinctly;
a sorry sight for one that had known
the fellow in more bustling circumstances
Nature might at least have paused to shed one
tear over this rough-jacketed little son of hers,
for his wasted aims, his cancelled ambitions,
his whole career of usefulness cut suddenly
short. But not a bit of it! Jubilant as ever,
her song went bubbling on, and ‘Death-in-Life’—and
again, ‘Life-in-Death,’ were its
alternate burdens. And looking round, and
seeing the sheep-nibbled heels of turnips that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
dotted the ground, their hearts eaten out of
them in frost-bound days now over and done, I
seemed to discern, faintly, a something of the
stern meaning in her valorous chant.</p>

<p>My invisible companion was singing also, and
seemed at times to be chuckling softly to himself,—doubtless
at thought of the strange new
lessons he was teaching me; perhaps, too, at a
special bit of waggishness he had still in store.
For when at last he grew weary of such insignificant
earth-bound company, he deserted me at
a certain spot I knew; then dropped, subsided,
and slunk away into nothingness. I raised my
eyes, and before me, grim and lichened, stood
the ancient whipping-post of the village; its
sides fretted with the initials of a generation
that scorned its mute lesson, but still clipped
by the stout rusty shackles that had tethered
the wrists of such of that generation’s ancestors
as had dared to mock at order and law. Had I
been an infant Sterne, here was a grand chance
for sentimental output! As things were, I could
only hurry homewards, my moral tail well between
my legs, with an uneasy feeling, as I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
glanced back over my shoulder, that there was
more in this chance than met the eye.</p>

<p>And outside our gate I found Charlotte,
alone and crying. Edward, it seemed, had
persuaded her to hide, in the full expectation
of being duly found and ecstatically pounced
upon; then he had caught sight of the butcher’s
cart, and, forgetting his obligations, had rushed
off for a ride. Harold, it further appeared,
greatly coveting tadpoles, and top-heavy with
the eagerness of possession, had fallen into the
pond. This, in itself, was nothing; but on
attempting to sneak in by the back-door, he
had rendered up his duckweed-bedabbled person
into the hands of an aunt, and had been promptly
sent off to bed; and this, on a holiday, was very
much. The moral of the whipping-post was
working itself out; and I was not in the least
surprised when, on reaching home, I was seized
upon and accused of doing something I had
never even thought of. And my frame of mind
was such, that I could only wish most heartily
that I had done it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a><br><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a><br><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span></p>

<h2>A WHITE-WASHED UNCLE</h2>


<p class="drop-cap">IN our small lives that day was eventful when
another uncle was to come down from town,
and submit his character and qualifications (albeit
unconsciously) to our careful criticism.
Earlier uncles had been weighed in the balance,
and—alas!—found grievously wanting.
There was Uncle Thomas—a failure from the
first. Not that his disposition was malevolent,
nor were his habits such as to unfit him for
decent society; but his rooted conviction seemed
to be that the reason of a child’s existence was
to serve as a butt for senseless adult jokes—or
what, from the accompanying guffaws of laughter,
appeared to be intended for jokes. Now,
we were anxious that he should have a perfectly
fair trial; so in the tool-house, between breakfast
and lessons, we discussed and examined all
his witticisms one by one, calmly, critically,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
dispassionately. It was no good: we could not
discover any salt in them. And as only a genuine
gift of humour could have saved Uncle
Thomas—for he pretended to naught besides—he
was reluctantly writ down a hopeless
impostor.</p>

<p>Uncle George—the youngest—was distinctly
more promising. He accompanied us cheerily
round the establishment—suffered himself to be
introduced to each of the cows—held out the
right hand of fellowship to the pig—and even
hinted that a pair of pink-eyed Himalayan
rabbits might arrive—unexpectedly—from
town some day. We were just considering
whether in this fertile soil an apparently accidental
remark on the solid qualities of guinea-pigs
or ferrets might haply blossom and bring
forth fruit, when our governess appeared on
the scene. Uncle George’s manner at once
underwent a complete and contemptible change.
His interest in rational topics seemed, ‘like a
fountain’s sickening pulse,’ to flag and ebb
away; and though Miss Smedley’s ostensible
purpose was to take Selina for her usual walk,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
I can vouch for it that Selina spent her morning
ratting, along with the keeper’s boy and me;
while if Miss Smedley walked with any one,
it would appear to have been with Uncle
George.</p>

<p>But, despicable as his conduct had been, he
underwent no hasty condemnation. The defection
was discussed in all its bearings, but it
seemed sadly clear at last that this uncle must
possess some innate badness of character and
fondness for low company. We who from daily
experience knew Miss Smedley like a book—were
we not only too well aware that she had
neither accomplishments nor charms—no characteristic,
in fact, but an inbred viciousness of
temper and disposition? True, she knew the
dates of the English kings by heart; but how
could that profit Uncle George, who, having
passed into the army, had ascended beyond the
need of useful information? Our bows and
arrows, on the other hand, had been freely
placed at his disposal; and a soldier should not
have hesitated in his choice a moment. No:
Uncle George had fallen from grace, and was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
unanimously damned. And the non-arrival of
the Himalayan rabbits was only another nail
in his coffin. Uncles, therefore, were just then
a heavy and lifeless market, and there was little
inclination to deal. Still it was agreed that
Uncle William, who had just returned from
India, should have as fair a trial as the others;
more especially as romantic possibilities might
well be embodied in one who had held the
gorgeous East in fee.</p>

<p>Selina had kicked my shins—like the girl
she is!—during a scuffle in the passage, and I
was still rubbing them with one hand when I
found that the uncle-on-approbation was half-heartedly
shaking the other. A florid, elderly
man, quite unmistakably nervous, he let drop
one grimy paw after another, and, turning very
red, with an awkward simulation of heartiness,
‘Well, h’are y’all?’ he said, ‘Glad to see me,
eh?’ As we could hardly, in justice, be expected
to have formed an opinion on him at that
early stage, we could but look at each other in
silence; which scarce served to relieve the tension
of the situation. Indeed, the cloud never<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
really lifted during his stay. In talking things
over later, some one put forward the suggestion
that he must at some time or other have committed
a stupendous crime. But I could not
bring myself to believe that the man, though
evidently unhappy, was really guilty of anything;
and I caught him once or twice looking
at us with evident kindliness, though, seeing
himself observed, he blushed and turned away
his head.</p>

<p>When at last the atmosphere was clear of
his depressing influence, we met despondently
in the potato-cellar—all of us, that is, but
Harold, who had been told off to accompany
his relative to the station; and the feeling was
unanimous, that, as an uncle, William could not
be allowed to pass. Selina roundly declared
him a beast, pointing out that he had not even
got us a half-holiday; and, indeed, there seemed
little to do but to pass sentence. We were
about to put it to the vote, when Harold
appeared on the scene; his red face, round eyes,
and mysterious demeanour, hinting at awful
portents. Speechless he stood a space: then,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
slowly drawing his hand from the pocket of his
knickerbockers, he displayed on a dirty palm
one—two—three—four half-crowns! We
could but gaze—tranced, breathless, mute.
Never had any of us seen, in the aggregate, so
much bullion before. Then Harold told his tale.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 499px;">

<div class="caption">“WHEN AT LAST THE ATMOSPHERE WAS CLEAR OF HIS DEPRESSING<br>
INFLUENCE, WE MET DESPONDENTLY IN THE POTATO-CELLAR”</div>
</div>

<p>‘I took the old fellow to the station,’ he said,
‘and as we went along I told him all about the
stationmaster’s family, and how I had seen the
porter kissing our housemaid, and what a nice
fellow he was, with no airs or affectation about
him, and anything I thought would be of
interest; but he didn’t seem to pay much
attention, but walked along puffing his cigar,
and once I thought—I’m not certain, but I
<i>thought</i>—I heard him say, “Well, thank God,
that’s over!” When we got to the station he
stopped suddenly, and said, “Hold on a minute!”
Then he shoved these into my hand in
a frightened sort of way, and said, “Look here,
youngster! These are for you and the other
kids. Buy what you like—make little beasts
of yourselves—only don’t tell the old people,
mind! Now cut away home!” So I cut.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span></p>

<p>A solemn hush fell on the assembly, broken
first by the small Charlotte. ‘I didn’t know,’
she observed dreamily, ‘that there were such
good men anywhere in the world. I hope he’ll
die to-night, for then he’ll go straight to heaven!’
But the repentant Selina bewailed herself with
tears and sobs, refusing to be comforted; for
that in her haste she had called this white-souled
relative a beast.</p>

<p>‘I’ll tell you what we’ll do,’ said Edward,
the master-mind, rising—as he always did—to
the situation: ‘We’ll christen the piebald pig
after him—the one that hasn’t got a name
yet. And that’ll show we’re sorry for our
mistake!’</p>

<p>‘I—I christened that pig this morning,’
Harold guiltily confessed; ‘I christened it after
the curate. I’m very sorry—but he came and
bowled to me last night, after you others had
all been sent to bed early—and somehow I felt
I <i>had</i> to do it!’</p>

<p>‘Oh, but that doesn’t count,’ said Edward
hastily; ‘because we weren’t all there. We’ll
take that christening off, and call it Uncle<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
William. And you can save up the curate for
the next litter!’</p>

<p>And the motion being agreed to without a
division, the House went into Committee of
Supply.</p>

<h2>ALARUMS AND EXCURSIONS</h2>


<p class="drop-cap">‘LET’S pretend,’ suggested Harold, ‘that
we’re Cavaliers and Roundheads; and
<i>you</i> be a Roundhead!’</p>

<p>‘O bother,’ I replied drowsily, ‘we pretended
that yesterday; and it’s not my turn to be a
Roundhead, anyhow.’ The fact is, I was lazy,
and the call to arms fell on indifferent ears.
We three younger ones were stretched at
length in the orchard. The sun was hot, the
season merry June, and never (I thought) had
there been such wealth and riot of buttercups
throughout the lush grass. Green-and-gold was
the dominant key that day. Instead of active
‘pretence’ with its shouts and its perspiration,
how much better—I held—to lie at ease and
pretend to one’s self, in green and golden
fancies, slipping the husk and passing, a careless
lounger, through a sleepy imaginary world all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
gold and green! But the persistent Harold
was not to be fobbed off.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 498px;">
<img src="The%20Project%20Gutenberg%20eBook%20of%20The%20Golden%20Age,%20by%20Kenneth%20Grahame_files/illus057.jpg" alt="childrfen in woods by stream" height="699" width="498">
<div class="caption">“INSTEAD OF ACTIVE ‘PRETENCE’ WITH ITS SHOUTS AND ITS<br>
PERSPIRATION, HOW MUCH BETTER—I HELD—TO LIE AT EASE<br>
AND PRETEND TO ONE’S SELF, IN GREEN AND GOLDEN FANCIES”</div>
</div>

<p>‘Well then,’ he began afresh, ‘let’s pretend
we’re Knights of the Round Table; and (with
a rush) <i>I’ll</i> be Lancelot!’</p>

<p>‘I won’t play unless I’m Lancelot,’ I said.
I didn’t mean it really, but the game of Knights
always began with this particular contest.</p>

<p>‘O <i>please</i>,’ implored Harold. ‘You know
when Edward’s here I never get a chance of
being Lancelot. I haven’t been Lancelot for
weeks!’</p>

<p>Then I yielded gracefully. ‘All right,’ I
said. ‘I’ll be Tristram.’</p>

<p>‘O, but you can’t,’ cried Harold again.
‘Charlotte has always been Tristram. She
won’t play unless she’s allowed to be Tristram!
Be somebody else this time.’</p>

<p>Charlotte said nothing, but breathed hard,
looking straight before her. The peerless
hunter and harper was her special hero of
romance, and rather than see the part in less
appreciative hands, she would have gone back
in tears to the stuffy schoolroom.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span></p>

<p>‘I don’t care,’ I said: ‘I’ll be anything. I’ll
be Sir Kay. Come on!’</p>

<p>Then once more in this country’s story the
mail-clad knights paced through the greenwood
shaw, questing adventure, redressing wrong;
and bandits, five to one, broke and fled discomfited
to their caves. Once more were
damsels rescued, dragons disembowelled, and
giants, in every corner of the orchard, deprived
of their already superfluous number of heads;
while Palomides the Saracen waited for us by
the well, and Sir Breuse Saunce Pité vanished
in craven flight before the skilled spear that
was his terror and his bane. Once more the
lists were dight in Camelot, and all was gay
with shimmer of silk and gold; the earth shook
with thunder of hooves, ash-staves flew in
splinters, and the firmament rang to the clash
of sword on helm. The varying fortune of the
day swung doubtful—now on this side, now
on that; till at last Lancelot, grim and great,
thrusting through the press, unhorsed Sir Tristram
(an easy task), and bestrode her, threatening
doom; while the Cornish knight, forgetting<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
hard-won fame of old, cried piteously, ‘You’re
hurting me, I tell you! and you’re tearing my
frock!’ Then it happed that Sir Kay, hurtling
to the rescue, stopped short in his stride, catching
sight suddenly, through apple-boughs, of a
gleam of scarlet afar off; while the confused
tramp of many horses, mingled with talk and
laughter, was borne to the ears of his fellow-champions
and himself.</p>

<p>‘What is it?’ inquired Tristram, sitting up
and shaking out her curls; while Lancelot forsook
the clanging lists and trotted nimbly to
the boundary-hedge.</p>

<p>I stood spell-bound for a moment longer, and
then, with a cry of ‘Soldiers!’ I was off to the
hedge, Sir Tristram picking herself up and
scurrying after us.</p>

<p>Down the road they came, two and two, at an
easy walk; scarlet flamed in the eye, bits jingled
and saddles squeaked delightfully; while the
men, in a halo of dust, smoked their short
clays like the heroes they were. In a swirl of
intoxicating glory the troop clinked and clattered
by, while we shouted and waved, jumping<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
up and down, and the big jolly horsemen
acknowledged the salute with easy condescension.
The moment they were past we were
through the hedge and after them. Soldiers
were not the common stuff of everyday life.
There had been nothing like this since the
winter before last, when on a certain afternoon—bare
of leaf and monochromatic in its hue
of sodden fallow and frost-nipt copse—suddenly
the hounds had burst through the fence with
their mellow cry, and all the paddock was for
the minute reverberant of thudding hoof and
dotted with glancing red. But this was better,
since it could only mean that blows and bloodshed
were in the air.</p>

<p>‘Is there going to be a battle?’ panted Harold,
hardly able to keep up for excitement.</p>

<p>‘Of course there is,’ I replied. ‘We’re just
in time. Come on!’</p>

<p>Perhaps I ought to have known better; and
yet——? The pigs and poultry, with whom we
chiefly consorted, could instruct us little concerning
the peace that lapped in these latter
days our seagirt realm. In the schoolroom<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
we were just now dallying with the Wars of the
Roses; and did not legends of the country-side
inform us how cavaliers had once galloped up
and down these very lanes from their quarters
in the village? Here, now, were soldiers unmistakable;
and if their business was not fighting,
what was it? Sniffing the joy of battle, we
followed hard in their tracks.</p>

<p>‘Won’t Edward be sorry,’ puffed Harold,
‘that he’s begun that beastly Latin?’</p>

<p>It did, indeed, seem hard. Edward, the most
martial spirit of us all, was drearily conjugating
<i>amo</i> (of all verbs!) between four walls, while
Selina, who ever thrilled ecstatic to a red coat,
was struggling with the uncouth German tongue.
‘Age,’ I reflected, ‘carries its penalties.’</p>

<p>It was a grievous disappointment to us that
the troop passed through the village unmolested.
Every cottage, I pointed out to my companions,
ought to have been loopholed, and strongly held.
But no opposition was offered to the soldiers
who, indeed, conducted themselves with a recklessness
and a want of precaution that seemed
simply criminal.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span></p>

<p>At the last cottage a transitory gleam of
common sense flickered across me, and, turning
on Charlotte, I sternly ordered her back. The
small maiden, docile but exceedingly dolorous,
dragged reluctant feet homewards, heavy at
heart that she was to behold no stout fellows
slain that day; but Harold and I held steadily
on, expecting every instant to see the environing
hedges crackle and spit forth the leaden death.</p>

<p>‘Will they be Indians?’ asked my brother
(meaning the enemy) ‘or Roundheads, or
what?’</p>

<p>I reflected. Harold always required direct
straightforward answers—not faltering suppositions.</p>

<p>‘They won’t be Indians,’ I replied at last;
‘nor yet Roundheads. There haven’t been
any Roundheads seen about here for a long
time. They’ll be Frenchmen.’</p>

<p>Harold’s face fell. ‘All right,’ he said:
‘Frenchmen’ll do; but I did hope they’d
be Indians.’</p>

<p>‘If they were going to be Indians,’ I explained,
‘I—I don’t think I’d go on. Because<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
when Indians take you prisoner they scalp
you first, and then burn you at the stake. But
Frenchmen don’t do that sort of thing.’</p>

<p>‘Are you quite sure?’ asked Harold doubtfully.</p>

<p>‘Quite,’ I replied. ‘Frenchmen only shut
you up in a thing called the Bastille; and then
you get a file sent in to you in a loaf of bread,
and saw the bars through, and slide down a
rope, and they all fire at you—but they don’t
hit you—and you run down to the seashore as
hard as you can, and swim off to a British
frigate, and there you are!’</p>

<p>Harold brightened up again. The programme
was rather attractive. ‘If they try to take us
prisoner,’ he said, ‘we—we won’t run, will
we?’</p>

<p>Meanwhile, the craven foe was a long time
showing himself; and we were reaching strange
outland country, uncivilised, wherein lions might
be expected to prowl at nightfall. I had a
stitch in my side, and both Harold’s stockings
had come down. Just as I was beginning to
have gloomy doubts of the proverbial courage<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
of Frenchmen, the officer called out something,
the men closed up, and, breaking into a trot,
the troops—already far ahead—vanished out
of our sight. With a sinking at the heart, I
began to suspect we had been fooled.</p>

<p>‘Are they charging?’ cried Harold, very
weary, but rallying gamely.</p>

<p>‘I think not,’ I replied doubtfully. ‘When
there’s going to be a charge, the officer always
makes a speech, and then they draw their swords
and the trumpets blow, and——but let’s try a
short cut. We may catch them up yet.’</p>

<p>So we struck across the fields and into
another road, and pounded down that, and
then over more fields, panting, down-hearted,
yet hoping for the best. The sun went in, and
a thin drizzle began to fall; we were muddy,
breathless, almost dead-beat; but we blundered
on, till at last we struck a road more brutally,
more callously unfamiliar than any road I ever
looked upon. Not a hint nor a sign of friendly
direction or assistance on the dogged white face
of it! There was no longer any disguising it:
we were hopelessly lost. The small rain continued<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
steadily, the evening began to come
on. Really there are moments when a fellow
is justified in crying; and I would have cried
too, if Harold had not been there. That right-minded
child regarded an elder brother as a
veritable god; and I could see that he felt
himself as secure as if a whole Brigade of
Guards had hedged him round with protecting
bayonets. But I dreaded sore lest he should
begin again with his questions.</p>

<p>As I gazed in dumb appeal on the face
of unresponsive nature, the sound of nearing
wheels sent a pulse of hope through my being:
increasing to rapture as I recognised in the
approaching vehicle the familiar carriage of the
old doctor. If ever a god emerged from a
machine, it was when this heaven-sent friend,
recognising us, stopped and jumped out with a
cheery hail. Harold rushed up to him at once.
‘Have you been there?’ he cried. ‘Was it a
jolly fight? who beat? were there many people
killed?’</p>

<p>The doctor appeared puzzled. I briefly explained
the situation.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span></p>

<p>‘I see,’ said the doctor, looking grave and
twisting his face this way and that. ‘Well,
the fact is, there isn’t going to be any battle
to-day. It’s been put off, on account of the
change in the weather. You will have due
notice of the renewal of hostilities. And now
you’d better jump in and I’ll drive you home.
You’ve been running a fine rig! Why, you
might have both been taken and shot as spies!’</p>

<p>This special danger had never even occurred
to us. The thrill of it accentuated the cosy
homelike feeling of the cushions we nestled into
as we rolled homewards. The doctor beguiled
the journey with blood-curdling narratives of
personal adventure in the tented field, he having
followed the profession of arms (so it seemed)
in every quarter of the globe. Time, the destroyer
of all things beautiful, subsequently
revealed the baselessness of these legends; but
what of that? There are higher things than
truth; and we were almost reconciled, by the
time we were put down at our gate, to the fact
that the battle had been postponed.</p>

<h2>THE FINDING OF THE PRINCESS</h2>


<p class="drop-cap">IT was the day I was promoted to a toothbrush.
The girls, irrespective of age, had
been thus distinguished some time before; why,
we boys could never rightly understand, except
that it was part and parcel of a system of
studied favouritism on behalf of creatures both
physically inferior and (as was shown by a
fondness for tale-bearing) of weaker mental
fibre to us boys. It was not that we yearned
after these strange instruments in themselves.
Edward, indeed, applied his to the scrubbing-out
of his squirrel’s cage, and for personal use,
when a superior eye was grim on him, borrowed
Harold’s or mine, indifferently. But the nimbus
of distinction that clung to them—that we
coveted exceedingly. What more, indeed, was
there to ascend to, before the remote, but still
possible, razor and strop?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span></p>

<p>Perhaps the exaltation had mounted to my
head; or nature and the perfect morning joined
to hint at disaffection. Anyhow, having breakfasted,
and triumphantly repeated the collect
I had broken down in the last Sunday—’twas
one without rhythm or alliteration: a most
objectionable collect—having achieved thus
much, the small natural man in me rebelled,
and I vowed, as I straddled and spat about the
stable-yard in feeble imitation of the coachman,
that lessons might go to the Inventor of them.
It was only geography that morning, any way:
and the practical thing was worth any quantity
of bookish theoric. As for me, I was going on
my travels, and imports and exports, populations
and capitals, might very well wait while I explored
the breathing coloured world outside.</p>

<p>True, a fellow-rebel was wanted; and Harold
might, as a rule, have been counted on with
certainty. But just then Harold was very
proud. The week before he had ‘gone into
tables,’ and had been endowed with a new slate,
having a miniature sponge attached wherewith
we washed the faces of Charlotte’s dolls, thereby<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
producing an unhealthy pallor which struck
terror into the child’s heart, always timorous
regarding epidemic visitations. As to ‘tables,’
nobody knew exactly what they were, least of
all Harold; but it was a step over the heads
of the rest, and therefore a subject for self-adulation
and—generally speaking—airs; so
that Harold, hugging his slate and his chains,
was out of the question now. In such a matter,
girls were worse than useless, as wanting the
necessary tenacity of will and contempt for self-constituted
authority. So eventually I slipped
through the hedge a solitary protestant, and
issued forth on the lane what time the rest of the
civilised world was sitting down to lessons.</p>

<p>The scene was familiar enough; and yet, this
morning, how different it all seemed! The act,
with its daring, tinted everything with new
strange hues; affecting the individual with a
sort of bruised feeling just below the pit of the
stomach, that was intensified whenever his
thoughts flew back to the ink-stained smelly
schoolroom. And could this be really me? or
was I only contemplating, from the schoolroom<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
aforesaid, some other jolly young mutineer,
faring forth under the genial sun? Anyhow,
here was the friendly well, in its old place, half-way
up the lane. Hither the yoke-shouldering
village-folk were wont to come to fill their
clinking buckets; when the drippings made
worms of wet in the thick dust of the road.
They had flat wooden crosses inside each pail,
which floated on the top and (we were instructed)
served to prevent the water from
slopping over. We used to wonder by what
magic this strange principle worked, and who
first invented the crosses, and whether he got
a peerage for it. But indeed the well was a
centre of mystery, for a hornet’s nest was
somewhere hard by, and the very thought was
fearsome. Wasps we knew well and disdained,
storming them in their fastnesses. But these
great Beasts, vestured in angry orange, three
stings from which—so ’twas averred—would
kill a horse, these were of a different kidney,
and their dreadful drone suggested prudence
and retreat. At this time neither villagers nor
hornets encroached on the stillness: lessons,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
apparently, pervaded all nature. So, after
dabbling awhile in the well—what boy has
ever passed a bit of water without messing in
it?—I scrambled through the hedge, shunning
the hornet-haunted side, and struck into the
silence of the copse.</p>

<p>If the lane had been deserted, this was loneliness
become personal. Here mystery lurked
and peeped; here brambles caught and held
you with a purpose of their own; here saplings
whipped your face with human spite. The
copse, too, proved vaster in extent, more direfully
drawn out, than one would ever have
guessed from its frontage on the lane: and I
was really glad when at last the wood opened
and sloped down to a streamlet brawling forth
into the sunlight. By this cheery companion
I wandered along, conscious of little but that
Nature, in providing store of water-rats, had
thoughtfully furnished provender of right-sized
stones. Rapids, also, there were, telling of
canoes and portages—crinkling bays and inlets—caves
for pirates and hidden treasures—the
wise Dame had forgotten nothing—till at last,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
after what lapse of time I know not, my further
course, though not the stream’s, was barred by
some six feet of stout wire netting, stretched
from side to side just where a thick hedge,
arching till it touched, forbade all further
view.</p>

<p>The excitement of the thing was becoming
thrilling. A Black Flag must surely be fluttering
close by? Here was most plainly a malignant
contrivance of the Pirates, designed to
baffle our gun-boats when we dashed up-stream
to shell them from their lair! A gun-boat,
indeed, might well have hesitated, so stout was
the netting, so close the hedge. But I spied
where a rabbit was wont to pass, close down
by the water’s edge; where a rabbit could go
a boy could follow, howbeit stomach-wise and
with one leg in the stream; so the passage was
achieved, and I stood inside, safe but breathless
at the sight.</p>

<p>Gone was the brambled waste, gone the
flickering tangle of woodland. Instead, terrace
after terrace of shaven sward, stone-edged, urn-cornered,
stepped delicately down to where the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
stream, now tamed and educated, passed from
one to another marble basin, in which on occasion
gleams of red hinted at gold-fish poised
among the spreading water-lilies. The scene
lay silent and slumbrous in the brooding noon-day
sun: the drowsing peacock squatted humped
on the lawn, no fish leaped in the pools, no bird
declared himself from the trim secluding hedges.
Self-confessed it was here, then, at last, the
Garden of Sleep!</p>

<p>Two things, in those old days, I held in
especial distrust: gamekeepers and gardeners.
Seeing, however, no baleful apparitions of
either quality, I pursued my way between rich
flower-beds, in search of the necessary Princess.
Conditions declared her presence patently as
trumpets; without this centre such surroundings
could not exist. A pavilion, gold-topped,
wreathed with lush jessamine, beckoned with
a special significance over close-set shrubs.
There, if anywhere, She should be enshrined.
Instinct, and some knowledge of the habits of
princesses, triumphed; for (indeed) there She
was! In no tranced repose, however, but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
laughingly, struggling to disengage her hand
from the grasp of a grown-up man who occupied
the marble bench with her. (As to age,
I suppose now that the two swung in respective
scales that pivoted on twenty. But children
heed no minor distinctions. To them, the
inhabited world is composed of the two main
divisions: children and upgrown people; the
latter in no way superior to the former—only
hopelessly different. These two, then, belonged
to the grown-up section.) I paused, thinking it
strange they should prefer seclusion when there
were fish to be caught, and butterflies to hunt
in the sun outside; and as I cogitated thus,
the grown-up man caught sight of me.</p>

<p>‘Hallo, sprat!’ he said with some abruptness;
‘Where do you spring from?’</p>

<p>‘I came up the stream,’ I explained politely
and comprehensively, ‘and I was only looking
for the Princess.’</p>

<p>‘Then you are a water-baby,’ he replied.
‘And what do you think of the Princess, now
you’ve found her?’</p>

<p>‘I think she is lovely,’ I said (and doubtless<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
I was right, having never learned to flatter).
‘But she’s wide-awake, so I suppose somebody
has kissed her!’</p>

<p>This very natural deduction moved the
grown-up man to laughter; but the Princess,
turning red and jumping up, declared that it
was time for lunch.</p>

<p>‘Come along, then,’ said the grown-up man;
‘and you too, water-baby. Come and have
something solid. You must want it.’</p>

<p>I accompanied them without any feeling of
false delicacy. The world, as known to me,
was spread with food each several mid-day,
and the particular table one sat at seemed a
matter of no importance. The palace was very
sumptuous and beautiful, just what a palace
ought to be; and we were met by a stately lady,
rather more grown-up than the Princess—apparently
her mother. My friend the Man was
very kind, and introduced me as the Captain,
saying I had just run down from Aldershot. I
didn’t know where Aldershot was, but I had no
manner of doubt that he was perfectly right.
As a rule, indeed, grown-up people are fairly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
correct on matters of fact; it is in the higher
gift of imagination that they are so sadly to
seek.</p>

<p>The lunch was excellent and varied. Another
gentleman in beautiful clothes—a lord
presumably—lifted me into a high carved
chair, and stood behind it, brooding over me
like a Providence. I endeavoured to explain
who I was and where I had come from, and
to impress the company with my own toothbrush
and Harold’s tables; but either they
were stupid—or is it a characteristic of Fairyland
that every one laughs at the most ordinary
remarks? My friend the Man said good-naturedly,
‘All right, Water-baby; you came up
the stream, and that’s good enough for us.’
The lord—a reserved sort of man, I thought—took
no share in the conversation.</p>

<p>After lunch I walked on the terrace with
the Princess and my friend the Man, and was
very proud. And I told him what I was going
to be, and he told me what he was going to be;
and then I remarked, ‘I suppose you two are
going to get married?’ He only laughed, after<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
the Fairy fashion. ‘Because if you aren’t,’ I
added, ‘you really ought to’: meaning only
that a man who discovered a Princess, living
in the right sort of Palace like this, and didn’t
marry her there and then, was false to all
recognised tradition.</p>

<p>They laughed again, and my friend suggested
I should go down to the pond and look at the
gold-fish, while they went for a stroll. I was
sleepy, and assented; but before they left me,
the grown-up man put two half-crowns in my
hand, for the purpose, he explained, of treating
the other water-babies. I was so touched by
this crowning mark of friendship that I nearly
cried; and I thought much more of his generosity
than of the fact that the Princess, ere she
moved away, stooped down and kissed me.</p>

<p>I watched them disappear down the path—how
naturally arms seem to go round waists in
Fairyland!—and then, my cheek on the cool
marble, lulled by the trickle of water, I slipped
into dreamland out of real and magic world
alike. When I woke, the sun had gone in, a
chill wind set all the leaves a-whispering, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
the peacock on the lawn was harshly calling up
the rain. A wild unreasoning panic possessed
me, and I sped out of the garden like a guilty
thing, wriggled through the rabbit-run, and
threaded my doubtful way homewards, hounded
by nameless terrors. The half-crowns happily
remained solid and real to the touch; but could
I hope to bear such treasure safely through the
brigand-haunted wood? It was a dirty, weary
little object that entered its home, at nightfall,
by the unassuming aid of the scullery-window:
and only to be sent tealess to bed seemed infinite
mercy to him. Officially tealess, that is;
for, as was usual after such escapades, a sympathetic
housemaid, coming delicately by back-stairs,
stayed him with chunks of cold pudding
and condolence, till his small skin was tight as
any drum. Then, nature asserting herself, I
passed into the comforting kingdom of sleep,
where, a golden carp of fattest build, I oared
it in translucent waters with a new half-crown
snug under right fin and left; and thrust up a
nose through water-lily leaves to be kissed by
a rose-flushed Princess.</p>

<h2>SAWDUST AND SIN</h2>


<p class="drop-cap">A BELT of rhododendrons grew close down
to one side of our pond; and along the
edge of it many things flourished rankly. If you
crept through the undergrowth and crouched by
the water’s rim, it was easy—if your imagination
were in healthy working order—to transport
yourself in a trice to the heart of a tropical
forest. Overhead the monkeys chattered, parrots
flashed from bough to bough, strange large
blossoms shone all round you, and the push and
rustle of great beasts moving unseen thrilled
you deliciously. And if you lay down with
your nose an inch or two from the water, it
was not long ere the old sense of proportion
vanished clean away. The glittering insects
that darted to and fro on its surface became
sea-monsters dire, the gnats that hung above
them swelled to albatrosses, and the pond itself<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
stretched out into a vast inland sea, whereon a
navy might ride secure, and whence at any
moment the hairy scalp of a sea-serpent might
be seen to emerge.</p>

<p>It is impossible, however, to play at tropical
forests properly, when homely accents of the
human voice intrude; and all my hopes of
seeing a tiger seized by a crocodile while
drinking (<i>vide</i> picture-books, <i>passim</i>) vanished
abruptly, and earth resumed her old dimensions,
when the sound of Charlotte’s prattle somewhere
hard by broke in on my primæval seclusion.
Looking out from the bushes, I saw her trotting
towards an open space of lawn the other side
the pond, chattering to herself in her accustomed
fashion, a doll tucked under either arm, and her
brow knit with care. Propping up her double
burthen against a friendly stump, she sat down
in front of them, as full of worry and anxiety as
a Chancellor on a Budget night.</p>

<p>Her victims, who stared resignedly in front
of them, were recognisable as Jerry and Rosa.
Jerry hailed from far Japan: his hair was
straight and black, his one garment cotton of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
a simple blue; and his reputation was distinctly
bad. Jerome was his proper name, from his
supposed likeness to the holy man who hung in
a print on the staircase; though a shaven crown
was the only thing in common ’twixt Western
saint and Eastern sinner. Rosa was typical
British, from her flaxen poll to the stout calves
she displayed so liberally; and in character she
was of the blameless order of those who have
not yet been found out.</p>

<p>I suspected Jerry from the first. There was
a latent devilry in his slant eyes as he sat there
moodily; and knowing what he was capable of,
I scented trouble in store for Charlotte. Rosa
I was not so sure about; she sat demurely and
upright, and looked far away into the tree-tops
in a visionary, world-forgetting sort of way; yet
the prim purse of her mouth was somewhat
overdone, and her eyes glittered unnaturally.</p>

<p>‘Now, I’m going to begin where I left off,’
said Charlotte, regardless of stops, and thumping
the turf with her fist excitedly: ‘and you
must pay attention, ’cos this is a treat, to have a
story told you before you’re put to bed. Well,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
so the White Rabbit scuttled off down the
passage and Alice hoped he’d come back ’cos
he had a waistcoat on and her flamingo flew up
a tree—but we haven’t got to that part yet, you
must wait a minute, and—where had I got to?’</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;">
<img src="The%20Project%20Gutenberg%20eBook%20of%20The%20Golden%20Age,%20by%20Kenneth%20Grahame_files/illus091.jpg" alt="girl crouched down by water" height="707" width="500">
<div class="caption">“‘NOW WE’LL GO ON,’ BEGAN CHARLOTTE ONCE MORE”</div>
</div>

<p>Jerry only remained passive until Charlotte
had got well under way, and then began to
heel over quietly in Rosa’s direction. His
head fell on her plump shoulder, causing her
to start nervously.</p>

<p>Charlotte seized and shook him with vigour.
‘O Jerry,’ she cried piteously, ‘if you’re not
going to be good, how ever shall I tell you my
story?’</p>

<p>Jerry’s face was injured innocence itself.
‘Blame if you like, Madam,’ he seemed to
say, ‘the eternal laws of gravitation, but not a
helpless puppet, who is also an orphan and a
stranger in the land.’</p>

<p>‘Now we’ll go on,’ began Charlotte once
more. ‘So she got into the garden at last—I’ve
left out a lot but you won’t care, I’ll tell
you some other time—and they were all playing
croquet, and that’s where the flamingo comes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
in, and the Queen shouted out, “Off with her
head!”’</p>

<p>At this point Jerry collapsed forward, suddenly
and completely, his bald pate between
his knees. Charlotte was not very angry this
time. The sudden development of tragedy in
the story had evidently been too much for the
poor fellow. She straightened him out, wiped
his nose, and, after trying him in various positions,
to which he refused to adapt himself,
she propped him against the shoulder of the
(apparently) unconscious Rosa. Then my eyes
were opened, and the full measure of Jerry’s
infamy became apparent. This, then, was what
he had been playing up for! The rascal had
designs, had he? I resolved to keep him under
close observation.</p>

<p>‘If you’d been in the garden,’ went on
Charlotte reproachfully, ‘and flopped down
like that when the Queen said “Off with his
head!” she’d have offed with your head; but
Alice wasn’t that sort of girl at all. She just
said, “I’m not afraid of you, you’re nothing
but a pack of cards”—O dear! I’ve got to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
the end already, and I hadn’t begun hardly! I
never can make my stories last out! Never
mind, I’ll tell you another one.’</p>

<p>Jerry didn’t seem to care, now he had gained
his end, whether the stories lasted out or not.
He was nestling against Rosa’s plump form
with a look of satisfaction that was simply
idiotic; and one arm had disappeared from
view—was it round her waist? Rosa’s natural
blush seemed deeper than usual, her head inclined
shyly—it must have been round her
waist.</p>

<p>‘If it wasn’t so near your bedtime,’ continued
Charlotte reflectively, ‘I’d tell you a nice story
with a bogy in it. But you’d be frightened,
and you’d dream of bogies all night. So I’ll
tell you one about a White Bear, only you
mustn’t scream when the bear says ‘Wow,’ like
I used to, ’cos he’s a good bear really——’</p>

<p>Here Rosa fell flat on her back in the deadest
of faints. Her limbs were rigid, her eyes glassy.
What had Jerry been doing? It must have
been something very bad, for her to take on
like that. I scrutinised him carefully, while<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
Charlotte ran to comfort the damsel. He appeared
to be whistling a tune and regarding the
scenery. If I only possessed Jerry’s command
of feature, I thought to myself, half regretfully,
I would never be found out in anything.</p>

<p>‘It’s all your fault, Jerry,’ said Charlotte
reproachfully, when the lady had been restored
to consciousness: ‘Rosa’s as good as gold
except when you make her wicked. I’d put
you in the corner, only a stump hasn’t got a
corner—wonder why that is? Thought everything
had corners. Never mind, you’ll have to
sit with your face to the wall—<i>so</i>. Now you
can sulk if you like!’</p>

<p>Jerry seemed to hesitate a moment between
the bliss of indulgence in sulks with a sense of
injury, and the imperious summons of beauty
waiting to be wooed at his elbow; then, overmastered
by his passion, he fell sideways across
Rosa’s lap. One arm stuck stiffly upwards, as
in passionate protestation; his amorous countenance
was full of entreaty. Rosa hesitated—wavered—yielded,
crushing his slight frame
under the weight of her full-bodied surrender.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span></p>

<p>Charlotte had stood a good deal, but it was
possible to abuse even her patience. Snatching
Jerry from his lawless embraces, she reversed
him across her knee, and then—the outrage
offered to the whole superior sex in Jerry’s
hapless person was too painful to witness; but
though I turned my head away the sound of
brisk slaps continued to reach my tingling ears.
When I dared to look again, Jerry was sitting
up as before; his garment, somewhat crumpled,
was restored to its original position; but his
pallid countenance was set hard. Knowing as
I did, only too well, what a volcano of passion
and shame must be seething under that impassive
exterior, for the moment I felt sorry for him.</p>

<p>Rosa’s face was still buried in her frock; it
might have been shame, it might have been
grief for Jerry’s sufferings. But the callous
Japanese never even looked her way. His
heart was exceeding bitter within him. In
merely following up his natural impulses he had
run his head against convention, and learned
how hard a thing it was; and the sunshiny
world was all black to him. Even Charlotte<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
softened somewhat at the sight of his rigid
misery. ‘If you’ll say you’re sorry, Jerome,’
she said, ‘I’ll say I’m sorry, too.’</p>

<p>Jerry only dropped his shoulders against the
stump and stared out in the direction of his dear
native Japan, where love was no sin, and smacking
had not been introduced. Why had he ever
left it? He would go back to-morrow! And
yet there were obstacles: another grievance.
Nature, in endowing Jerry with every grace of
form and feature, along with a sensitive soul,
had somehow forgotten the gift of locomotion.</p>

<p>There was a crackling in the bushes behind
me, with sharp short pants as of a small steam-engine,
and Rollo, the black retriever, just
released from his chain by some friendly hand,
burst through the underwood, seeking congenial
company. I joyfully hailed him to stop and be
a panther, but he sped away round the pond,
upset Charlotte with a boisterous caress, and
seizing Jerry by the middle, disappeared with
him down the drive. Charlotte panting, raved
behind the swift-footed avenger of crime; Rosa
lay dishevelled, bereft of consciousness; Jerry<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
himself spread helpless arms to heaven, and I
almost thought I heard a cry for mercy, a tardy
promise of amendment. But it was too late.
The Black Man had got Jerry at last; and
though the tear of sensibility might bedew an
eye or two for his lost sake, no one who really
knew him could deny the justice of his fate.</p>

<h2>‘YOUNG ADAM CUPID’</h2>


<p class="drop-cap">NOBODY would have suspected Edward
of being in love, had it not been that
after breakfast, with an overacted carelessness,
‘Anybody who likes,’ he said, ‘can feed my
rabbits,’ and he disappeared, with a jauntiness
that deceived nobody, in the direction of the
orchard. Now kingdoms might totter and reel,
and convulsions play skittles with the map of
Europe; but the iron unwritten law prevailed,
that each boy severely fed his own rabbits.
There was good ground, then, for suspicion and
alarm; and while the lettuce leaves were being
drawn through the wires, Harold and I conferred
seriously on the situation.</p>

<p>It may be thought that the affair was none
of our business; and indeed we cared little
as individuals. We were only concerned as
members of a corporation, for each of whom<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
the mental or physical ailment of one of his
fellows might have far-reaching effects. It was
thought best that Harold, as least open to suspicion
of motive, should be despatched to probe
and peer. His instructions were, to proceed by
a report on the health of our rabbits in particular;
to glide gently into a discussion concerning
rabbits in general, their customs, practices, and
vices; and to pass thence, by a natural transition,
to the female sex, the inherent flaws in its
composition, and the reasons for regarding it
(speaking broadly) as dirt. He was especially
to be very diplomatic, and then to return and
report progress. He departed on his mission
gaily; but his absence was short, and his return,
discomfited and in tears, seemed to betoken
some want of parts for diplomacy. He had
found Edward, it appeared, pacing the orchard,
with the sort of set smile that mountebanks
wear in their precarious antics, fixed painfully
on his face, as with pins. Harold had opened
well, on the rabbit subject, but, with a fatal
confusion between the abstract and the concrete,
had then gone on to remark that Edward’s<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
lop-eared doe, with her long hindlegs and contemptuous
twitch of the nose, always reminded
him of Sabina Larkin (a nine-year-old damsel,
child of a neighbouring farmer): at which point
Edward, it would seem, had turned upon and
savagely maltreated him, twisting his arm and
punching him in the short ribs. So that Harold
returned to the rabbit-hutches preceded by long-drawn
wails: anon wishing, with tears and sobs,
that he were a man, to kick his love-lorn
brother; anon lamenting that ever he had been
born.</p>

<p>I was not big enough to stand up to Edward
personally, so I had to console the sufferer by
allowing him to grease the wheels of the donkey-cart—a
luscious treat that had been specially
reserved for me, a week past, by the gardener’s
boy, for putting in a good word on his behalf
with the new kitchen-maid. Harold was soon
all smiles and grease; and I was not, on the
whole, dissatisfied with the significant hint that
had been gained as to the <i>fons et origo mali</i>.</p>

<p>Fortunately, means were at hand for resolving
any doubts on the subject, since the morning<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
was Sunday, and already the bells were ringing
for church. Lest the connexion may not be
evident at first sight, I should explain that
the gloomy period of church-time, with its
enforced inaction and its lack of real interest—passed,
too, within sight of all that the village
held of fairest—was just the one when a young
man’s fancies lightly turned to thoughts of love.
The rest of the week afforded no leisure for
such trifling; but in church—well, there was
really nothing else to do! True, noughts-and-crosses
might be indulged in on flyleaves of
prayer-books while the Litany dragged its slow
length along; but what balm or what solace
could be found for the Sermon? Naturally the
eye, wandering here and there among the serried
ranks, made bold untrammelled choice among
our fair fellow-supplicants. It was in this way
that, some months earlier, under the exceptional
strain of the Athanasian Creed, my roving fancy
had settled upon the baker’s wife as a fit object
for a life-long devotion. Her riper charms had
conquered a heart which none of her be-muslined
tittering juniors had been able to subdue; and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
that she was already wedded had never occurred
to me as any bar to my affection. Edward’s
general demeanour, then, during morning service
was safe to convict him; but there was also a
special test for the particular case. It happened
that we sat in a transept, and, the Larkins being
behind us, Edward’s only chance of feasting on
Sabina’s charms was in the all-too fleeting interval
when we swung round eastwards. I was not
mistaken. During the singing of the Benedictus
the impatient one made several false starts, and
at last he slewed fairly round before ‘As it was
in the beginning, is now, and ever shall be’ was
half finished. The evidence was conclusive: a
court of law could have desired no better.</p>

<p>The fact being patent, the next thing was
to grapple with it; and my mind was fully
occupied during the sermon. There was really
nothing unfair or unbrotherly in my attitude.
A philosophic affection such as mine own, which
clashed with nothing, was (I held) permissible;
but the volcanic passions in which Edward
indulged about once a quarter were a serious
interference with business. To make matters<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
worse, next week there was a circus coming to
the neighbourhood, to which we had all been
strictly forbidden to go; and without Edward
no visit in contempt of law and orders could be
successfully brought off. I had sounded him
as to the circus on our way to church, and he
had replied briefly that the very thought of a
clown made him sick. Morbidity could no
further go. But the sermon came to an end
without any line of conduct having suggested
itself; and I walked home in some depression,
feeling sadly that Venus was in the ascendant
and in direful opposition, while Auriga—the
circus star—drooped declinant, perilously near
the horizon.</p>

<p>By the irony of fate, Aunt Eliza, of all
people, turned out to be the <i>Dea ex machinâ</i>.
The thing fell out in this wise. It was that
lady’s obnoxious practice to issue forth, of a
Sunday afternoon, on a visit of state to such
farmers and cottagers as dwelt at hand; on
which occasion she was wont to hale a reluctant
boy along with her, from the mixed motives of
propriety and his soul’s health. Much cudgelling<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
of brains, I suppose, had on that particular
day made me torpid and unwary. Anyhow,
when a victim came to be sought for, I fell an
easy prey, while the others fled scatheless and
whooping. Our first visit was to the Larkins.
Here ceremonial might be viewed in its finest
flower, and we conducted ourselves, like Queen
Elizabeth when she trod the measure, ‘high and
disposedly.’ In the low oak-panelled parlour
cake and currant wine were set forth, and, after
courtesies and compliments exchanged, Aunt
Eliza, greatly condescending, talked the fashions
with Mrs. Larkin; while the farmer and I,
perspiring with the unusual effort, exchanged
remarks on the mutability of the weather and
the steady fall in the price of corn. (Who
would have thought, to hear us, that only two
short days ago we had confronted each other on
either side of a hedge? I triumphant, provocative,
derisive? He flushed, wroth, cracking his
whip, and volleying forth profanity? So powerful
is all-subduing ceremony!) Sabina the
while, demurely seated with a <i>Pilgrim’s
Progress</i> on her knee, and apparently absorbed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
in a brightly-coloured presentment of ‘Apollyon
Straddling Right across the Way,’ eyed me at
times with shy interest; but repelled all Aunt
Eliza’s advances with a frigid politeness for
which I could not sufficiently admire her.</p>

<p>‘It’s surprising to me,’ I heard my aunt
remark presently, ‘how my eldest nephew,
Edward, despises little girls. I heard him tell
Charlotte the other day that he wished he could
exchange her for a pair of Japanese guinea-pigs.
It made the poor child cry. Boys are so
heartless!’ (I saw Sabina stiffen as she sat,
and her tip-tilted nose twitched scornfully.)
‘Now this boy here——’ (my soul descended
into my very boots. Could the woman have
intercepted any of my amorous glances at the
baker’s wife?) ‘Now this boy,’ my aunt went
on, ‘is more human altogether. Only yesterday
he took his sister to the baker’s shop, and spent
his only penny buying her sweets. I thought
it showed such a nice disposition. I wish
Edward were more like him!’</p>

<p>I breathed again. It was unnecessary to
explain my real motives for that visit to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
baker’s. Sabina’s face softened, and her contemptuous
nose descended from its altitude of
scorn; she gave me one shy glance of kindness,
and then concentrated her attention upon Mercy
knocking at the Wicket Gate. I felt awfully
mean as regarded Edward; but what could I
do? I was in Gaza, gagged and bound; the
Philistines hemmed me in.</p>

<p>The same evening the storm burst, the bolt
fell, and—to continue the metaphor—the
atmosphere grew serene and clear once more.
The evening service was shorter than usual, the
vicar, as he ascended the pulpit steps, having
dropped two pages out of his sermon-case—unperceived
by any but ourselves, either at the
moment or subsequently when the hiatus was
reached; so, as we joyfully shuffled out I
whispered Edward that by racing home at top
speed we should make time to assume our
bows and arrows (laid aside for the day) and
play at Indians and buffaloes with Aunt Eliza’s
fowls—already strolling roostwards, regardless
of their doom—before that sedately stepping
lady could return. Edward hung at the door,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
wavering; the suggestion had unhallowed
charms. At that moment Sabina issued primly
forth, and, seeing Edward, put out her tongue
at him in the most exasperating manner conceivable;
then passed on her way, her shoulders
rigid, her dainty head held high. A man can
stand very much in the cause of love: poverty,
aunts, rivals, barriers of every sort, all these
only serve to fan the flame. But personal
ridicule is a shaft that reaches the very vitals.
Edward led the race home at a speed which
one of Ballantyne’s heroes might have equalled
but never surpassed; and that evening the
Indians dispersed Aunt Eliza’s fowls over
several square miles of country, so that the
tale of them remaineth incomplete unto this
day. Edward himself, cheering wildly, pursued
the big Cochin-China cock till the bird sank
gasping under the drawing-room window,
whereat its mistress stood petrified; and after
supper, in the shrubbery, smoked a half-consumed
cigar he had picked up in the road, and
declared to an awe-stricken audience his final,
his immitigable resolve to go into the army.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>The crisis was past, and Edward was saved!&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
And yet .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. <i>sunt lachrymæ rerum</i> .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. to
me watching the cigar-stump alternately pale
and glow against the dark background of laurel,
a vision of a tip-tilted nose, of a small head poised
scornfully, seemed to hover on the gathering
gloom—seemed to grow and fade and grow
again, like the grin of the Cheshire cat—pathetically,
reproachfully even; and the charms of
the baker’s wife slipped from my memory like
snow-wreaths in thaw. After all, Sabina was
nowise to blame: why should the child be
punished? To-morrow I would give them the
slip, and stroll round by her garden promiscuous-like,
at a time when the farmer was safe in
the rick-yard. If nothing came of it, there was
no harm done; and if on the contrary.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;!</p>

<h2>THE BURGLARS</h2>


<p class="drop-cap">IT was much too fine a night to think of going
to bed at once, and so, although the witching
hour of nine <small>P.M.</small> had struck, Edward and I
were still leaning out of the open window in
our nightshirts, watching the play of the cedar-branch
shadows on the moonlit lawn, and
planning schemes of fresh devilry for the sunshiny
morrow. From below, strains of the
jocund piano declared that the Olympians were
enjoying themselves in their listless impotent
way; for the new curate had been bidden to
dinner that night, and was at the moment
unclerically proclaiming to all the world that
he feared no foe. His discordant vociferations
doubtless started a train of thought in Edward’s
mind, for he presently remarked, <i>à propos</i> of
nothing whatever that had been said before, ‘I
believe the new curate’s rather gone on Aunt
Maria.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span></p>

<p>I scouted the notion; ‘Why, she’s quite old,’
I said. (She must have seen some five-and-twenty
summers.)</p>

<p>‘Of course she is,’ replied Edward scornfully.
‘It’s not her, it’s her money he’s after, you
bet!’</p>

<p>‘Didn’t know she had any money,’ I observed
timidly.</p>

<p>‘Sure to have,’ said my brother with confidence.
‘Heaps and heaps.’</p>

<p>Silence ensued, both our minds being busy
with the new situation thus presented: mine,
in wonderment at this flaw that so often
declared itself in enviable natures of fullest
endowment,—in a grown-up man and a good
cricketer, for instance, even as this curate;
Edward’s (apparently) in the consideration of
how such a state of things, supposing it existed,
could be best turned to his own advantage.</p>

<p>‘Bobby Ferris told me,’ began Edward in
due course, ‘that there was a fellow spooning
his sister once——’</p>

<p>‘What’s spooning?’ I asked meekly.</p>

<p>‘O <i>I</i> dunno,’ said Edward indifferently.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
‘It’s—it’s—it’s just a thing they do, you
know. And he used to carry notes and messages
and things between ’em, and he got a
shilling almost every time.’</p>

<p>‘What, from each of ’em?’ I innocently
inquired.</p>

<p>Edward looked at me with scornful pity.
‘Girls never have any money,’ he briefly explained.
‘But she did his exercises, and got
him out of rows, and told stories for him when
he needed it—and much better ones than he
could have made up for himself. Girls are
useful in some ways. So he was living in
clover, when unfortunately they went and
quarrelled about something.’</p>

<p>‘Don’t see what that’s got to do with it,’ I
said.</p>

<p>‘Nor don’t I,’ rejoined Edward. ‘But any
how the notes and things stopped, and so did
the shillings. Bobby was fairly cornered, for
he had bought two ferrets on tick, and promised
to pay a shilling a week, thinking the shillings
were going on for ever, the silly young ass.
So when the week was up, and he was being<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
dunned for the shilling, he went off to the
fellow and said: “Your broken-hearted Bella
implores you to meet her at sundown. By the
hollow oak as of old, be it only for a moment.
Do not fail!” He got all that out of some
rotten book, of course. The fellow looked
puzzled and said:</p>

<p>‘“What hollow oak? I don’t know any
hollow oak.”</p>

<p>‘“Perhaps it was the Royal Oak?” said
Bobby promptly, ’cos he saw he had made a
slip, through trusting too much to the rotten
book; but this didn’t seem to make the fellow
any happier.’</p>

<p>‘Should think not,’ I said, ‘the Royal Oak’s
an awful low sort of pub.’</p>

<p>‘I know,’ said Edward. ‘Well, at last the
fellow said, “I think I know what she means:
the hollow tree in your father’s paddock. It
happens to be an elm, but she wouldn’t know
the difference. All right: say I’ll be there.”
Bobby hung about a bit, for he hadn’t got his
money. “She was crying awfully,” he said.
Then he got his shilling.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span></p>

<p>‘And wasn’t the fellow riled,’ I inquired,
‘when he got to the place and found nothing?’</p>

<p>‘He found Bobby,’ said Edward indignantly.
‘Young Ferris was a gentleman, every inch of
him. He brought the fellow another message
from Bella: “I dare not leave the house. My
cruel parents immure me closely. If you only
knew what I suffer. Your broken-hearted
Bella.” Out of the same rotten book. This
made the fellow a little suspicious, ’cos it was
the old Ferrises who had been keen about the
thing all through. The fellow, you see, had
tin.’</p>

<p>‘But what’s that got to——’ I began again.</p>

<p>‘O <i>I</i> dunno,’ said Edward impatiently. ‘I’m
telling you just what Bobby told me. He got
suspicious, anyhow, but he couldn’t exactly call
Bella’s brother a liar, so Bobby escaped for the
time. But when he was in a hole next week,
over a stiff French exercise, and tried the same
sort of game on his sister, she was too sharp for
him, and he got caught out. Somehow women
seem more mistrustful than men. They’re so
beastly suspicious by nature, you know.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span></p>

<p>‘<i>I</i> know,’ said I. ‘But did the two—the
fellow and the sister—make it up afterwards?’</p>

<p>‘I don’t remember about that,’ replied Edward
indifferently; ‘but Bobby got packed off to
school a whole year earlier than his people meant
to send him. Which was just what he wanted.
So you see it all came right in the end!’</p>

<p>I was trying to puzzle out the moral of this
story—it was evidently meant to contain one
somewhere—when a flood of golden lamplight
mingled with the moon-rays on the lawn, and
Aunt Maria and the new curate strolled out on
the grass below us, and took the direction of a
garden-seat which was backed by a dense laurel
shrubbery reaching round in a half-circle to the
house. Edward meditated moodily. ‘If we
only knew what they were talking about,’ said
he, ‘you’d soon see whether I was right or not.
Look here! Let’s send the kid down by the
porch to reconnoitre!’</p>

<p>‘Harold’s asleep,’ I said; ‘it seems rather a
shame——’</p>

<p>‘O rot!’ said my brother; ‘he’s the youngest,
and he’s got to do as he’s told!’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span></p>

<p>So the luckless Harold was hauled out of
bed and given his sailing-orders. He was
naturally rather vexed at being stood up
suddenly on the cold floor, and the job had no
particular interest for him; but he was both
staunch and well disciplined. The means of
exit were simple enough. A porch of iron
trellis came up to within easy reach of the
window, and was habitually used by all three
of us, when modestly anxious to avoid public
notice. Harold climbed deftly down the porch
like a white rat, and his night-gown glimmered
a moment on the gravel walk ere he was lost to
sight in the darkness of the shrubbery. A brief
interval of silence ensued; broken suddenly by
a sound of scuffle, and then a shrill long-drawn
squeal, as of metallic surfaces in friction. Our
scout had fallen into the hands of the enemy!</p>

<p>Indolence alone had made us devolve the
task of investigation on our younger brother.
Now that danger had declared itself, there was
no hesitation. In a second we were down the
side of the porch, and crawling Cherokee-wise
through the laurels to the back of the garden-seat.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
Piteous was the sight that greeted us.
Aunt Maria was on the seat, in a white evening
frock, looking—for an aunt—really quite nice.
On the lawn stood an incensed curate, grasping
our small brother by a large ear, which—judging
from the row he was making—seemed on
the point of parting company with the head it
completed and adorned. The gruesome noise he
was emitting did not really affect us otherwise
than æsthetically. To one who has tried both,
the wail of genuine physical anguish is easily
distinguishable from the pumped-up <i>ad misericordiam</i>
blubber. Harold’s could clearly be
recognised as belonging to the latter class.
‘Now you young—’ (whelp, <i>I</i> think it was, but
Edward stoutly maintains it was devil), said the
curate sternly; ‘tell us what you mean by it!’</p>

<p>‘Well leggo of my ear then!’ shrilled Harold,
‘and I’ll tell you the solemn truth!’</p>

<p>‘Very well,’ agreed the curate, releasing him,
‘now go ahead, and don’t lie more than you can
help.’</p>

<p>We abode the promised disclosure without
the least misgiving; but even we had hardly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
given Harold due credit for his fertility of
resource and powers of imagination.</p>

<p>‘I had just finished saying my prayers,’ began
that young gentleman slowly, ‘when I happened
to look out of the window, and on the lawn I
saw a sight which froze the marrow in my veins!
A burglar was approaching the house with snake-like
tread! He had a scowl and a dark lantern,
and he was armed to the teeth!’</p>

<p>We listened with interest. The style, though
unlike Harold’s native notes, seemed strangely
familiar.</p>

<p>‘Go on,’ said the curate grimly.</p>

<p>‘Pausing in his stealthy career,’ continued
Harold, ‘he gave a low whistle. Instantly the
signal was responded to, and from the adjacent
shadows two more figures glided forth. The
miscreants were both armed to the teeth.’</p>

<p>‘Excellent,’ said the curate; ‘proceed.’</p>

<p>‘The robber chief,’ pursued Harold, warming
to his work, ‘joined his nefarious comrades, and
conversed with them in silent tones. His expression
was truly ferocious, and I ought to
have said that he was armed to the t——’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span></p>

<p>‘There, never mind his teeth,’ interrupted the
curate rudely; ‘there’s too much jaw about
you altogether. Hurry up and have done.’</p>

<p>‘I was in a frightful funk,’ continued the
narrator, warily guarding his ear with his hand,
‘but just then the drawing-room window opened,
and you and Aunt Maria came out—I mean
emerged. The burglars vanished silently into
the laurels, with horrid implications!’</p>

<p>The curate looked slightly puzzled. The
tale was well sustained, and certainly circumstantial.
After all, the boy might really have
seen something. How was the poor man to
know—though the chaste and lofty diction
might have supplied a hint—that the whole
yarn was a free adaptation from the last Penny
Dreadful lent us by the knife-and-boot boy?</p>

<p>‘Why did you not alarm the house?’ he asked.</p>

<p>‘Cos I was afraid,’ said Harold sweetly,
‘that p’raps they mightn’t believe me!’</p>

<p>‘But how did you get down here, you
naughty little boy?’ put in Aunt Maria.</p>

<p>Harold was hard pressed—by his own flesh
and blood, too!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span></p>

<p>At that moment Edward touched me on the
shoulder and glided off through the laurels.
When some ten yards away he gave a low
whistle. I replied with another. The effect
was magical. Aunt Maria started up with a
shriek. Harold gave one startled glance around,
and then fled like a hare, made straight for the
back-door, burst in upon the servants at supper,
and buried himself in the broad bosom of the
cook, his special ally. The curate faced the
laurels—hesitatingly. But Aunt Maria flung
herself on him. ‘O Mr. Hodgitts!’ I heard
her cry, ‘you are brave! for my sake do not be
rash!’ He was not rash. When I peeped out
a second later, the coast was entirely clear.</p>

<p>By this time there were sounds of a household
timidly emerging; and Edward remarked
to me that perhaps we had better be off. Retreat
was an easy matter. A stunted laurel
gave a leg-up on to the garden wall, which led
in its turn to the roof of an out-house, up which,
at a dubious angle, we could crawl to the window
of the box-room. This overland route had
been revealed to us one day by the domestic cat,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
when hard pressed in the course of an otter-hunt,
in which the cat—somewhat unwillingly—was
filling the title <i>rôle;</i> and it had proved distinctly
useful on occasions like the present. We were
snug in bed—minus some cuticle from knees
and elbows—and Harold, sleepily chewing
something sticky, had been carried up in the
arms of the friendly cook, ere the clamour of
the burglar-hunters had died away.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 497px;">

<div class="caption">“THIS OVERLAND ROUTE HAD BEEN REVEALED TO<br>
US ONE DAY BY THE DOMESTIC CAT, WHEN HARD<br>
PRESSED IN THE COURSE OF AN OTTER-HUNT”</div>
</div>

<p>The curate’s undaunted demeanour, as reported
by Aunt Maria, was generally supposed
to have terrified the burglars into flight, and
much kudos accrued to him thereby. Some
days later, however, when he had dropped in to
afternoon tea, and was making a mild curatorial
joke about the moral courage required for taking
the last piece of bread-and-butter, I felt
constrained to remark dreamily, and as it were
to the universe at large: ‘Mr. Hodgitts! you
are brave! for my sake, do not be rash!’</p>

<p>Fortunately for me, the vicar also was a caller
on that day; and it was always a comparatively
easy matter to dodge my long-coated friend in
the open.</p>

<h2>A HARVESTING</h2>


<p class="drop-cap">THE year was in its yellowing time, and the
face of Nature a study in old gold. ‘A
field <i>or</i>, <i>semée</i> with garbs of the same:’ it may
be false Heraldry—Nature’s generally is—but
it correctly blazons the display that Edward and
I considered from the rickyard gate. Harold
was not on in this scene, being stretched
upon the couch of pain: the special disorder
stomachic, as usual. The evening before,
Edward, in a fit of unwonted amiability, had
deigned to carve me out a turnip lantern, an
art-and-craft he was peculiarly deft in; and
Harold, as the interior of the turnip flew out in
scented fragments under the hollowing knife,
had eaten largely thereof: regarding all such
jetsam as his special perquisite. Now he was
dreeing his weird, with such assistance as the
chemist could afford. But Edward and I,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
knowing that this particular field was to be
carried to-day, were revelling in the privilege
of riding in the empty waggons from the rickyard
back to the sheaves, whence we returned
toilfully on foot, to career it again over the
billowy acres in these great galleys of a stubble
sea. It was the nearest approach to sailing
that we inland urchins might compass: and
hence it ensued, that such stirring scenes as
Sir Richard Grenville on the <i>Revenge</i>, the
smoke-wreathed Battle of the Nile, and the
Death of Nelson, had all been enacted in turn
on these dusty quarter-decks, as they swayed
and bumped afield.</p>

<p>Another waggon had shot its load, and was
jolting out through the rickyard gate, as we
swung ourselves in, shouting, over its tail.
Edward was the first up, and, as I gained
my feet, he clutched me in a death-grapple.
I was a privateersman, he proclaimed, and he
the captain of the British frigate <i>Terpsichore</i>,
of—I forget the precise number of guns.
Edward always collared the best parts to himself;
but I was holding my own gallantly,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>
when I suddenly discovered that the floor
we battled on was swarming with earwigs.
Shrieking, I hurled free of him, and rolled
over the tail-board on to the stubble. Edward
executed a war-dance of triumph on the deck
of the retreating galleon; but I cared little
for that. I knew <i>he</i> knew that I wasn’t afraid
of him, but that I was—and terribly—of earwigs:
‘those mortal bugs o’ the field.’ So I
let him disappear, shouting lustily for all hands
to repel boarders, while I strolled inland, down
the village.</p>

<p>There was a touch of adventure in the expedition.
This was not our own village, but a
foreign one, distant at least a mile. One felt
that sense of mingled distinction and insecurity
which is familiar to the traveller: distinction,
in that folk turned the head to note you
curiously; insecurity, by reason of the ever-present
possibility of missiles on the part
of the younger inhabitants, a class eternally
Conservative. Elated with isolation, I went
even more nose-in-air than usual: and ‘even
so,’ I mused, ‘might Mungo Park have threaded<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
the trackless African forest and....’ Here
I plumped against a soft, but resisting body.</p>

<p>Recalled to my senses by the shock, I fell
back in the attitude every boy under these
circumstances instinctively adopts—both elbows
well up over your ears. I found myself facing
a tall elderly man, clean-shaven, clad in well-worn
black—a clergyman evidently; and I
noted at once a far-away look in his eyes, as
if they were used to another plane of vision,
and could not instantly focus things terrestrial,
being suddenly recalled thereto. His figure was
bent in apologetic protest. ‘I ask a thousand
pardons, sir,’ he said; ‘I am really so very
absent-minded. I trust you will forgive me.’</p>

<p>Now most boys would have suspected chaff
under this courtly style of address. I take
infinite credit to myself for recognising at once
the natural attitude of a man to whom his
fellows were gentlemen all, neither Jew nor
Gentile, clean nor unclean. Of course, I took
the blame on myself; adding, that I was very
absent-minded too. Which was indeed the
case.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span></p>

<p>‘I perceive,’ he said pleasantly, ‘that we have
something in common. I, an old man, dream
dreams; you, a young one, see visions. Your
lot is the happier. And now—’ his hand had
been resting all this time on a wicket-gate—‘you
are hot, it is easily seen;—the day is
advanced, <i>Virgo</i> is the Zodiacal sign. Perhaps
I may offer you some poor refreshment, if your
engagements will permit?’</p>

<p>My only engagement that afternoon was an
arithmetic lesson, and I had not intended to
keep it in any case; so I passed in, while he
held the gate open politely, murmuring, ‘<i>Venit
Hesperus, ite capellæ:</i> come, little kid!’ and
then apologising abjectly for a familiarity which
(he said) was less his than the Roman poet’s.
A straight flagged walk led up to the cool-looking
old house, and my host, lingering in
his progress at this rose-tree and that, forgot
all about me at least twice, waking up and
apologising humbly after each lapse. During
these intervals I put two and two together,
and identified him as the Rector: a bachelor,
eccentric, learned exceedingly, round whom the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>
crust of legend was already beginning to form;
to myself an object of special awe, in that
he was alleged to have written a real book.
‘Heaps o’ books,’ Martha, my informant, said;
but I knew the exact rate of discount applicable
to Martha’s statements.</p>

<div class="caption">“A STRAIGHT FLAGGED WALK LED UP TO THE COOL-LOOKING<br>
OLD HOUSE, AND MY HOST, LINGERING IN HIS PROGRESS AT THIS<br>
ROSE-TREE AND THAT, FORGOT ALL ABOUT ME AT LEAST TWICE”</div>
</div>

<p>We passed eventually through a dark hall
into a room which struck me at once as the
ideal I had dreamed but failed to find. None
of your feminine fripperies here! None of
your chair-backs and tidies! This man, it was
seen, groaned under no aunts. Stout volumes
in calf and vellum lined three sides; books
sprawled or hunched themselves on chairs and
tables; books diffused the pleasant odour of
printers’ ink and bindings; topping all, a faint
aroma of tobacco cheered and heartened exceedingly,
as under foreign skies the flap and
rustle over the wayfarer’s head of the Union
Jack—the old flag of emancipation! And in
one corner, book-piled like the rest of the furniture,
stood a piano.</p>

<p>This I hailed with a squeal of delight.
‘Want to strum?’ inquired my friend, as if<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
it was the most natural wish in the world—his
eyes were already straying towards another
corner, where bits of writing-table peeped out
from under a sort of Alpine system of book and
foolscap.</p>

<p>‘O but may I?’ I asked in doubt. ‘At
home I’m not allowed to—only beastly exercises!’</p>

<p>‘Well, you can strum here, at all events,’
he replied; and murmuring absently, ‘<i>Age, dic
Latinum, barbite, carmen</i>,’ he made his way,
mechanically guided as it seemed, to the irresistible
writing-table. In ten seconds he was
out of sight and call. A great book open on
his knee, another propped up in front, a score
or so disposed within easy reach, he read and
jotted with an absorption almost passionate. I
might have been in Bœotia, for any consciousness
he had of me. So with a light heart I
turned to and strummed.</p>

<p>Those who painfully and with bleeding feet
have scaled the crags of mastery over musical
instruments have yet their loss in this: that
the wild joy of strumming has become a vanished<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
sense. Their happiness comes from the
concord and the relative value of the notes
they handle: the pure, absolute quality and
nature of each note in itself are only appreciated
by the strummer. For some notes have
all the sea in them, and some cathedral bells;
others a woodland joyance and a smell of
greenery; in some fauns dance to the merry
reed, and even the grave centaurs peep out
from their caves. Some bring moonlight, and
some the deep crimson of a rose’s heart; some
are blue, some red, while others will tell of an
army with silken standards and march-music.
And throughout all the sequence of suggestion,
up above the little white men leap and peep,
and strive against the imprisoning wires; and
all the big rosewood box hums as it were full
of hiving bees.</p>

<p>Spent with the rapture, I paused a moment
and caught my friend’s eye over the edge of
a folio. ‘But as for these Germans,’ he began
abruptly, as if we had been in the middle of a
discussion, ‘the scholarship is there, I grant
you; but the spark, the fine perception, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>
happy intuition, where is it? They get it all
from us!’</p>

<p>‘They get nothing whatever from <i>us</i>,’ I said
decidedly: the word German only suggesting
Bands, to which Aunt Eliza was bitterly hostile.</p>

<p>‘You think not?’ he rejoined doubtfully, getting
up and walking about the room. ‘Well,
I applaud such fairness and temperance in so
young a critic. They are qualities—in youth—as
rare as they are pleasing. But just look
at Schrumpffius, for instance—how he struggles
and wrestles with a simple γἁρ in this very
passage here!’</p>

<p>I peeped fearfully through the open door,
half-dreading to see some sinuous and snark-like
conflict in progress on the mat; but all
was still. I saw no trouble at all in the passage,
and I said so.</p>

<p>‘Precisely,’ he cried, delighted. ‘To you,
who possess the natural scholar’s faculty in so
happy a degree, there is no difficulty at all.
But to this Schrumpffius——’ But here, luckily
for me, in came the housekeeper, a clean-looking
woman of staid aspect.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span></p>

<p>‘Your tea is in the garden,’ she said severely,
as if she were correcting a faulty emendation.
‘I’ve put some cakes and things for the little
gentleman; and you’d better drink it before it
gets cold.’</p>

<p>He waved her off and continued his stride,
brandishing an aorist over my devoted head.
The housekeeper waited unmoved till there
fell a moment’s break in his descant; and
then, ‘You’d better drink it before it gets
cold,’ she observed again, impassively. The
wretched man cast a deprecating look at me.
‘Perhaps a little tea would be rather nice,’ he
observed feebly; and to my great relief he led
the way into the garden. I looked about for the
little gentleman, but, failing to discover him, I
concluded he was absent-minded too, and
attacked the ‘cakes and things’ with no
misgivings.</p>

<p>After a most successful and most learned
tea a something happened which, small as I
was, never quite shook itself out of my memory.
To us at parley in an arbour over the high
road, there entered, slouching into view, a dingy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>
tramp, satellited by a frowsy woman and a
pariah dog; and, catching sight of us, he set
up his professional whine; and I looked at
my friend with the heartiest compassion, for
I knew well from Martha—it was common talk—that
at this time of day he was certainly and
surely penniless. Morn by morn he started
forth with pockets lined; and each returning
evening found him with never a sou. All this
he proceeded to explain at length to the tramp,
courteously and even shamefacedly, as one who
was in the wrong; and at last the gentleman
of the road, realising the hopelessness of his
case, set to and cursed him with gusto, vocabulary,
and abandonment. He reviled his eyes,
his features, his limbs, his profession, his relatives
and surroundings; and then slouched off,
still oozing malice and filth. We watched the
party to a turn in the road, where the woman,
plainly weary, came to a stop. Her lord, after
some conventional expletives demanded of him
by his position, relieved her of her bundle, and
caused her to hang on his arm with a certain
rough kindness of tone, and in action even a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>
dim approach to tenderness; and the dingy
dog crept up for one lick at her hand.</p>

<p>‘See,’ said my friend, bearing somewhat on
my shoulder, ‘how this strange thing, this love
of ours, lives and shines out in the unlikeliest
of places! You have been in the fields in early
morning? Barren acres, all! But only stoop—catch
the light thwartwise—and all is a silver
network of gossamer! So the fairy filaments of
this strange thing underrun and link together
the whole world. Yet it is not the old imperious
god of the fatal bow—ἑρως ανἱκατε μἁχαν—not
that—nor even the placid respectable στοργἡ—but
something still unnamed, perhaps more
mysterious, more divine! Only one must stoop
to see it, old fellow, one must stoop!’</p>

<p>The dew was falling, the dusk closing, as I
trotted briskly homewards down the road.
Lonely spaces everywhere, above and around.
Only Hesperus hung in the sky, solitary, pure,
ineffably far-drawn and remote; yet infinitely
heartening, somehow, in his valorous isolation.</p>

<h2>SNOWBOUND</h2>


<p class="drop-cap">TWELFTH-NIGHT had come and gone,
and life next morning seemed a trifle flat
and purposeless. But yester-eve, and the mummers
were here! They had come striding into
the old kitchen, powdering the red brick floor
with snow from their barbaric bedizenments; and
stamping, and crossing, and declaiming, till all
was whirl and riot and shout. Harold was
frankly afraid: unabashed, he buried himself
in the cook’s ample bosom. Edward feigned a
manly superiority to illusion, and greeted these
awful apparitions familiarly, as Dick and Harry
and Joe. As for me, I was too big to run, too
rapt to resist the magic and surprise. Whence
came these outlanders, breaking in on us with
song and ordered masque and a terrible clashing
of wooden swords? And after these, what
strange visitants might we not look for any quiet<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>
night, when the chestnuts popped in the ashes,
and the old ghost stories drew the awe-stricken
circle close? Old Merlin, perhaps, ‘all furred
in black sheep-skins, and a russet gown, with
a bow and arrows, and bearing wild geese in
his hand!’ Or stately Ogier the Dane, recalled
from Faëry, asking his way to the land that
once had need of him! Or even, on some
white night, the Snow-Queen herself, with a
chime of sleigh-bells and the patter of reindeer’s
feet, halting of a sudden at the door flung
wide, while aloft the Northern Lights went
shaking attendant spears among the quiet
stars!</p>

<p>This morning, house-bound by the relentless
indefatigable snow, I was feeling the reaction.
Edward, on the contrary, being violently stage-struck
on this his first introduction to the real
Drama, was striding up and down the floor,
proclaiming ‘Here be I, King Gearge the
Third,’ in a strong Berkshire accent. Harold,
accustomed, as the youngest, to lonely antics
and to sports that asked no sympathy, was
absorbed in ‘clubmen’: a performance consisting<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>
in a measured progress round the room arm-in-arm
with an imaginary companion of reverend
years, with occasional halts at imaginary clubs,
where—imaginary steps being leisurely ascended—imaginary
papers were glanced at,
imaginary scandal was discussed with elderly
shakings of the head, and—regrettable to say—imaginary
glasses were lifted lipwards. Heaven
only knows how the germ of this dreary pastime
first found way into his small-boyish being. It
was his own invention, and he was proportionately
proud of it. Meanwhile Charlotte and I,
crouched in the window-seat, watched, spell-stricken,
the whirl and eddy and drive of the
innumerable snow-flakes, wrapping our cheery
little world in an uncanny uniform, ghastly in
line and hue.</p>

<p>Charlotte was sadly out of spirits. Having
‘countered’ Miss Smedley at breakfast, during
some argument or other, by an apt quotation
from her favourite classic (the <i>Fairy Book</i>), she
had been gently but firmly informed that no
such things as fairies ever really existed. ‘Do
you mean to say it’s all lies?’ asked Charlotte<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>
bluntly. Miss Smedley deprecated the use of
any such unladylike words in any connexion
at all. ‘These stories had their origin, my
dear,’ she explained, ‘in a mistaken anthropomorphism
in the interpretation of nature. But
though we are now too well informed to fall
into similar errors, there are still many beautiful
lessons to be learned from these myths——’</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 497px;">

<div class="caption">“MEANWHILE CHARLOTTE AND I<br>
CROUCHED IN THE WINDOW-SEAT.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.”</div>
</div>

<p>‘But how can you learn anything,’ persisted
Charlotte, ‘from what doesn’t exist?’ And she
left the table defiant, howbeit depressed.</p>

<p>‘Don’t you mind <i>her</i>,’ I said consolingly;
‘how can she know anything about it? Why,
she can’t even throw a stone properly!’</p>

<p>‘Edward says they’re all rot, too,’ replied
Charlotte doubtfully.</p>

<p>‘Edward says everything’s rot,’ I explained,
‘now he thinks he’s going into the Army. If
a thing’s in a book it <i>must</i> be true, so that
settles it!’</p>

<p>Charlotte looked almost reassured. The room
was quieter now, for Edward had got the dragon
down and was boring holes in him with a purring
sound; Harold was ascending the steps of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>
Athenæum with a jaunty air—suggestive rather
of the Junior Carlton. Outside, the tall elm-tops
were hardly to be seen through the feathery
storm. ‘The sky’s a-falling,’ quoted Charlotte
softly; ‘I must go and tell the king.’ The quotation
suggested a fairy story, and I offered to
read to her, reaching out for the book. But the
Wee Folk were under a cloud; sceptical hints
had embittered the chalice. So I was fain to
fetch <i>Arthur</i>—second favourite with Charlotte
for his dames riding errant, and an easy first
with us boys for his spear-splintering crash of
tourney and hurtle against hopeless odds. Here
again, however, I proved unfortunate; what ill-luck
made the book open at the sorrowful history
of Balin and Balan? ‘And he vanished anon,’
I read: ‘and so he heard an horne blow, as it
had been the death of a beast. “That blast,”
said Balin, “is blowen for me, for I am the
prize, and yet am I not dead.”’ Charlotte
began to cry: she knew the rest too well. I
shut the book in despair. Harold emerged from
behind the arm-chair. He was sucking his
thumb (a thing which members of the Reform<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>
are seldom seen to do), and he stared wide-eyed
at his tear-stained sister. Edward put off his
histrionics, and rushed up to her as the consoler—a
new part for him.</p>

<p>‘I know a jolly story,’ he began. ‘Aunt
Eliza told it me. It was when she was somewhere
over in that beastly abroad’—(he had
once spent a black month of misery at Dinan)—‘and
there was a fellow there who had got
two storks. And one stork died—it was the
she-stork.’—(‘What did it die of?’ put in
Harold.)—‘And the other stork was quite
sorry, and moped, and went on, and got very
miserable. So they looked about and found a
duck, and introduced it to the stork. The
duck was a drake, but the stork didn’t mind,
and they loved each other and were as jolly as
could be. By and by another duck came along—a
real she-duck this time—and when the
drake saw her he fell in love, and left the stork,
and went and proposed to the duck: for she
was very beautiful. But the poor stork who
was left, he said nothing at all to anybody, but
just pined and pined and pined away, till one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>
morning he was found quite dead! But the
ducks lived happily ever afterwards!’</p>

<p>This was Edward’s idea of a jolly story!
Down again went the corners of poor Charlotte’s
mouth. Really Edward’s stupid inability to
see the real point in anything was <i>too</i> annoying!
It was always so. Years before, it being
necessary to prepare his youthful mind for a
domestic event that might lead to awkward
questionings at a time when there was little
leisure to invent appropriate answers, it was
delicately inquired of him whether he would
like to have a little brother, or perhaps a little
sister? He considered the matter carefully in
all its bearings, and finally declared for a Newfoundland
pup. Any boy more ‘gleg at the
uptak’ would have met his parents half-way,
and eased their burden. As it was, the matter
had to be approached all over again from a
fresh standpoint. And now, while Charlotte
turned away sniffingly, with a hiccup that told
of an overwrought soul, Edward, unconscious
(like Sir Isaac’s Diamond) of the mischief he had
done, wheeled round on Harold with a shout.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span></p>

<p>‘I want a live dragon,’ he announced: ‘You’ve
got to be my dragon!’</p>

<p>‘Leave me go, will you?’ squealed Harold,
struggling stoutly. ‘I’m playin’ at something
else. How can I be a dragon and belong to all
the clubs?’</p>

<p>‘But wouldn’t you like to be a nice scaly
dragon, all green,’ said Edward, trying persuasion,
‘with a curly tail and red eyes, and
breathing real smoke and fire?’</p>

<p>Harold wavered an instant: Pall-Mall was
still strong in him. The next he was grovelling
on the floor. No saurian ever swung a tail so
scaly and so curly as his. Clubland was a
thousand years away. With horrific pants he
emitted smokiest smoke and fiercest fire.</p>

<p>‘Now I want a Princess,’ cried Edward,
clutching Charlotte ecstatically; ‘and <i>you</i> can
be the Doctor, and heal me from the dragon’s
deadly wound.’</p>

<p>Of all professions I held the sacred art of
healing in worst horror and contempt. Cataclysmal
memories of purge and draught crowded
thick on me, and with Charlotte—who courted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span>
no barren honours—I made a break for the
door. Edward did likewise, and the hostile
forces clashed together on the mat, and for a
brief space things were mixed and chaotic and
Arthurian. The silvery sound of the luncheon-bell
restored an instant peace, even in the teeth
of clenched antagonisms like ours. The Holy
Grail itself, ‘sliding athwart a sunbeam,’ never
so effectually stilled a riot of warring passions
into sweet and quiet accord.</p>

<h2>WHAT THEY TALKED ABOUT</h2>


<p class="drop-cap">EDWARD was standing ginger-beer like a
gentleman, happening, as the one that had
last passed under the dentist’s hands, to be the
capitalist of the flying hour. As in all well-regulated
families, the usual tariff obtained in
ours: half-a-crown a tooth; one shilling only
if the molar were a loose one. This one,
unfortunately—in spite of Edward’s interested
affectation of agony—had been shakiness undisguised;
but the event was good enough to run
to ginger-beer. As financier, however, Edward
had claimed exemption from any servile duties
of procurement, and had swaggered about the
garden while I fetched from the village post-office,
and Harold stole a tumbler from the
pantry. Our preparations complete, we were
sprawling on the lawn; the staidest and most
self-respecting of the rabbits had been let loose<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>
to grace the feast, and was lopping demurely
about the grass, selecting the juiciest plantains;
while Selina, as the eldest lady present, was
toying, in her affected feminine way, with the
first full tumbler, daintily fishing for bits of
broken cork.</p>

<p>‘Hurry up, can’t you?’ growled our host;
‘what are you girls always so beastly particular
for?’</p>

<p>‘Martha says,’ explained Harold (thirsty too,
but still just), ‘that if you swallow a bit of cork,
it swells, and it swells, and it swells inside you,
till you——’</p>

<p>‘O bosh!’ said Edward, draining the glass
with a fine pretence of indifference to consequences,
but all the same (as I noticed) dodging
the floating cork-fragments with skill and
judgment.</p>

<p>‘O, it’s all very well to say bosh,’ replied
Harold nettled: ‘but every one knows it’s true
but you. Why, when Uncle Thomas was here
last, and they got up a bottle of wine for him,
he took just one tiny sip out of his glass, and
then he said, “Poo, my goodness, that’s<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>
corked!” And he wouldn’t touch it. And
they had to get a fresh bottle up. The funny
part was, though, I looked in his glass afterwards,
when it was brought out into the passage,
and there wasn’t any cork in it at all! So I
drank it all off, and it was very good!’</p>

<p>‘You’d better be careful, young man!’ said
his elder brother, regarding him severely:
‘D’you remember that night when the Mummers
were here, and they had mulled port, and
you went round and emptied all the glasses after
they had gone away?’</p>

<p>‘Ow! I did feel funny that night,’ chuckled
Harold. ‘Thought the house was comin’ down,
it jumped about so: and Martha had to carry
me up to bed, ’cos the stairs was goin’ all
waggity!’</p>

<p>We gazed searchingly at our graceless junior;
but it was clear that he viewed the matter in
the light of a phenomenon rather than of a
delinquency.</p>

<p>A third bottle was by this time circling; and
Selina, who had evidently waited for it to reach
her, took a most unfairly long pull, and then,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>
jumping up and shaking out her frock, announced
that she was going for a walk. Then she fled
like a hare; for it was the custom of our Family
to meet with physical coercion any independence
of action in individuals.</p>

<div class="caption">“‘SHE’S OFF WITH THOSE VICARAGE<br>
GIRLS AGAIN,’ SAID EDWARD”</div>
</div>

<p>‘She’s off with those Vicarage girls again,’
said Edward, regarding Selina’s long black legs
twinkling down the path. ‘She goes out with
them every day now; and as soon as ever they
start, all their heads go together and they
chatter, chatter, chatter the whole blessèd time!
I can’t make out what they find to talk about.
They never stop; it’s gabble, gabble, gabble
right along, like a nest of young rooks!’</p>

<p>‘P’raps they talk about birds’-eggs,’ I suggested
sleepily (the sun was hot, the turf soft,
the ginger-beer potent); ‘and about ships, and
buffaloes, and desert islands; and why rabbits
have white tails; and whether they’d sooner
have a schooner or a cutter; and what they’ll
be when they’re men—at least, I mean there’s
lots of things to talk about, if you <i>want</i> to
talk.’</p>

<p>‘Yes; but they don’t talk about those sort<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span>
of things at all,’ persisted Edward. ‘How <i>can</i>
they? They don’t <i>know</i> anything; they can’t
<i>do</i> anything—except play the piano, and nobody
would want to talk about <i>that;</i> and they don’t
care about anything—anything sensible, I mean.
So what <i>do</i> they talk about?’</p>

<p>‘I asked Martha once,’ put in Harold; ‘and
she said, “Never <i>you</i> mind; young ladies has
lots of things to talk about that young gentlemen
can’t understand.”’</p>

<p>‘I don’t believe it,’ Edward growled.</p>

<p>‘Well, that’s what she <i>said</i>, anyway,’ rejoined
Harold indifferently. The subject did not seem
to him of first-class importance, and it was
hindering the circulation of the ginger-beer.</p>

<p>We heard the click of the front-gate. Through
a gap in the hedge we could see the party setting
off down the road. Selina was in the middle; a
Vicarage girl had her by either arm; their heads
were together, as Edward had described; and
the clack of their tongues came down the breeze
like the busy pipe of starlings on a bright March
morning.</p>

<p>‘What <i>do</i> they talk about, Charlotte?’ I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>
inquired, wishing to pacify Edward. ‘You go
out with them sometimes.’</p>

<p>‘I don’t know,’ said poor Charlotte dolefully.
‘They make me walk behind, ’cos they say I’m
too little, and mustn’t hear. And I <i>do</i> want to
so,’ she added.</p>

<p>‘When any lady comes to see Aunt Eliza,’
said Harold, ‘they both talk at once all the
time. And yet each of ’em seems to hear what
the other one’s saying. I can’t make out how
they do it. Grown-up people are so clever!’</p>

<p>‘The Curate’s the funniest man,’ I remarked.
‘He’s always saying things that have no sense
in them at all, and then laughing at them as if
they were jokes. Yesterday, when they asked
him if he’d have some more tea, he said, “Once
more unto the breach, dear friends, once more,”
and then sniggered all over. I didn’t see anything
funny in that. And then somebody asked
him about his button-hole, and he said, “’Tis
but a little faded flower,” and exploded again.
I thought it very stupid.’</p>

<p>‘O <i>him</i>,’ said Edward contemptuously: ‘he
can’t help it, you know; it’s a sort of way he’s<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span>
got. But it’s these girls I can’t make out. If
they’ve anything really sensible to talk about,
how is it nobody knows what it is? And if
they haven’t—and we know they <i>can’t</i> have,
naturally—why don’t they shut up their jaw?
This old rabbit here—<i>he</i> doesn’t want to talk.
He’s got something better to do.’ And Edward
aimed a ginger-beer cork at the unruffled beast,
who never budged.</p>

<p>‘O but rabbits <i>do</i> talk,’ interposed Harold.
‘I’ve watched them often in their hutch. They
put their heads together and their noses go up
and down, just like Selina’s and the Vicarage
girls’. Only of course I can’t hear what they’re
saying.’</p>

<p>‘Well, if they do,’ said Edward unwillingly,
‘I’ll bet they don’t talk such rot as those girls
do!’ Which was ungenerous, as well as unfair;
for it had not yet transpired—nor has it
to this day—<i>what</i> Selina and her friends talked
about.</p>

<h2>THE ARGONAUTS</h2>


<p class="drop-cap">THE advent of strangers, of whatever sort,
into our circle had always been a matter
of grave dubiety and suspicion. Indeed, it was
generally a signal for retreat into caves and
fastnesses of the earth, into unthreaded copses
or remote outlying cowsheds, whence we were
only to be extricated by wily nursemaids, rendered
familiar by experience with our secret runs
and refuges. It was not surprising, therefore,
that the heroes of classic legend, when first we
made their acquaintance, failed to win our entire
sympathy at once. ‘Confidence,’ says somebody,
‘is a plant of slow growth’; and these
stately dark-haired demi-gods, with names hard
to master and strange accoutrements, had to
win a citadel already strongly garrisoned with
a more familiar soldiery. Their chill foreign
goddesses had no such direct appeal for us as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span>
the mocking malicious fairies and witches of
the North. We missed the pleasant alliance
of the animal—the fox who spread the bushiest
of tails to convey us to the enchanted castle, the
frog in the well, the raven who croaked advice
from the tree; and—to Harold especially—it
seemed entirely wrong that the hero should ever
be other than the youngest brother of three.
This belief, indeed, in the special fortune that
ever awaited the youngest brother, as such,—the
‘Borough-English’ of Faery,—had been
of baleful effect on Harold, producing a certain
self-conceit and perkiness that called for physical
correction. But even in our admonishment we
were on his side; and as we distrustfully eyed
these new arrivals, old Saturn himself seemed
something of a <i>parvenu</i>.</p>

<p>Even strangers, however, if they be good fellows
at heart, may develop into sworn comrades;
and these gay swordsmen, after all, were of the
right stuff. Perseus, with his cap of darkness
and his wonderful sandals, was not long in
winging his way to our hearts. Apollo knocked
at Admetus’ gate in something of the right fairy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span>
fashion. Psyche brought with her an orthodox
palace of magic, as well as helpful birds and
friendly ants. Ulysses, with his captivating
shifts and strategies, broke down the final
barrier, and henceforth the band was adopted
and admitted into our freemasonry.</p>

<p>I had been engaged in chasing Farmer Larkin’s
calves—his special pride—round the field,
just to show the man we hadn’t forgotten him,
and was returning through the kitchen-garden
with a conscience at peace with all men, when I
happened upon Edward, grubbing for worms in
the dung-heap. Edward put his worms into his
hat, and we strolled along together, discussing
high matters of state. As we reached the tool-shed,
strange noises arrested our steps; looking
in, we perceived Harold, alone, rapt, absorbed,
immersed in the special game of the moment.
He was squatting in an old pig-trough that had
been brought in to be tinkered; and as he rhapsodised,
anon he waved a shovel over his head,
anon dug it into the ground with the action
of those who would urge Canadian canoes.
Edward strode in upon him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span></p>

<p>‘What rot are you playing at now?’ he
demanded sternly.</p>

<p>Harold flushed up, but stuck to his pig-trough
like a man. ‘I’m Jason,’ he replied defiantly;
‘and this is the Argo. The other fellows are
here too, only you can’t see them; and we’re
just going through the Hellespont, so don’t you
come bothering.’ And once more he plied the
wine-dark sea.</p>

<p>Edward kicked the pig-trough contemptuously.
‘Pretty sort of Argo you’ve got!’ said he.</p>

<p>Harold began to get annoyed. ‘I can’t help
it,’ he retorted. ‘It’s the best sort of Argo I
can manage, and it’s all right if you only pretend
enough. But <i>you</i> never could pretend one
bit.’</p>

<p>Edward reflected. ‘Look here,’ he said
presently. ‘Why shouldn’t we get hold of
Farmer Larkin’s boat, and go right away up
the river in a real Argo, and look for Medea,
and the Golden Fleece, and everything? And
I’ll tell you what, I don’t mind your being
Jason, as you thought of it first.’</p>

<p>Harold tumbled out of the trough in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span>
excess of his emotion. ‘But we aren’t allowed
to go on the water by ourselves,’ he cried.</p>

<p>‘No,’ said Edward, with fine scorn: ‘we
aren’t allowed; and Jason wasn’t allowed
either, I daresay. But he <i>went!</i>’</p>

<p>Harold’s protest had been merely conventional:
he only wanted to be convinced by
sound argument. The next question was, How
about the girls? Selina was distinctly handy
in a boat: the difficulty about her was, that
if she disapproved of the expedition—and,
morally considered, it was not exactly a Pilgrim’s
Progress—she might go and tell; she
having just reached that disagreeable age when
one begins to develop a conscience. Charlotte,
for her part, had a habit of day-dreams, and was
as likely as not to fall overboard in one of her
rapt musings. To be sure, she would dissolve
in tears when she found herself left out; but
even that was better than a watery tomb. In
fine, the public voice—and rightly, perhaps—was
against the admission of the skirted animal:
despite the precedent of Atalanta, who was one
of the original crew.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span></p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 498px;">

<div class="caption">“WE PUT THE ARGO’S HEAD UPSTREAM, SINCE<br>
THAT LED AWAY FROM THE LARKIN PROVINCE”</div>
</div>

<p>‘And now,’ said Edward, ‘who’s to ask
Farmer Larkin? <i>I</i> can’t; last time I saw him
he said when he caught me again he’d smack
my head. <i>You’ll</i> have to.’</p>

<p>I hesitated, for good reasons. ‘You know
those precious calves of his?’ I began.</p>

<p>Edward understood at once. ‘All right,’ he
said; ‘then we won’t ask him at all. It doesn’t
much matter. He’d only be annoyed, and that
would be a pity. Now let’s set off.’</p>

<p>We made our way down to the stream, and
captured the farmer’s boat without let or hindrance,
the enemy being engaged in the hay-fields.
This ‘river,’ so called, could never be
discovered by us in any atlas; indeed our
Argo could hardly turn in it without risk of
shipwreck. But to us ’twas Orinoco, and the
cities of the world dotted its shores. We put
the Argo’s head upstream, since that led away
from the Larkin province; Harold was faithfully
permitted to be Jason, and we shared the
rest of the heroes among us. Then, quitting
Thessaly, we threaded the Hellespont with
shouts, breathlessly dodged the Clashing Rocks,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span>
and coasted under the lee of the Siren-haunted
isles. Lemnos was fringed with meadow-sweet,
dog-roses dotted the Mysian shore, and the
cheery call of the haymaking folk sounded
along the coast of Thrace.</p>

<p>After some hour or two’s seafaring, the prow
of the Argo embedded itself in the mud of a
landing-place, plashy with the tread of cows
and giving on to a lane that led towards the
smoke of human habitations. Edward jumped
ashore, alert for exploration, and strode off
without waiting to see if we followed; but I
lingered behind, having caught sight of a moss-grown
water-gate hard by, leading into a garden
that, from the brooding quiet lapping it round,
appeared to portend magical possibilities.</p>

<p>Indeed the very air within seemed stiller, as
we circumspectly passed through the gate; and
Harold hung back shamefaced, as if we were
crossing the threshold of some private chamber,
and ghosts of old days were hustling past us.
Flowers there were, everywhere; but they
drooped and sprawled in an overgrowth hinting
at indifference; the scent of heliotrope<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span>
possessed the place as if actually hung in solid
festoons from tall untrimmed hedge to hedge.
No basket-chairs, shawls, or novels dotted the
lawn with colour; and on the garden-front of
the house behind, the blinds were mostly drawn.
A grey old sun-dial dominated the central
sward, and we moved towards it instinctively,
as the most human thing in sight. An antick
motto ran round it, and with eyes and fingers
we struggled at the decipherment.</p>

<p><small>TIME: TRYETH: TROTHE</small>: spelt out Harold
at last. ‘I wonder what that means?’</p>

<p>I could not enlighten him, nor meet his further
questions as to the inner mechanism of the thing,
and where you wound it up. I had seen these
instruments before, of course; but had never
fully understood their manner of working.</p>

<p>We were still puzzling our heads over the
contrivance, when I became aware that Medea
herself was moving down the path from the
house. Dark-haired, supple, of a figure lightly
poised and swayed, but pale and listless—I
knew her at once, and having come out to
find her, naturally felt no surprise at all. But<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span>
Harold, who was trying to climb on to the top
of the sun-dial, having a cat-like fondness for
the summit of things, started and fell prone,
barking his chin and filling the pleasance with
lamentation.</p>

<p>Medea skimmed the ground swallow-like, and
in a moment was on her knees comforting him,
wiping the dirt out of his chin with her own
dainty handkerchief, and vocal with soft murmur
of consolation.</p>

<p>‘You needn’t take on so about him,’ I
observed politely. ‘He’ll cry for just one
minute, and then he’ll be all right.’</p>

<p>My estimate was justified. At the end of his
regulation time Harold stopped crying suddenly,
like a clock that had struck its hour; and with
a serene and cheerful countenance wriggled out
of Medea’s embrace, and ran for a stone to
throw at an intrusive blackbird.</p>

<p>‘O you boys!’ cried Medea, throwing wide
her arms with abandonment. ‘Where have
you dropped from? How dirty you are! I’ve
been shut up here for a thousand years, and all
that time I’ve never seen any one under a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span>
hundred and fifty! Let’s play at something, at
once!’</p>

<p>‘Rounders is a good game,’ I suggested.
‘Girls can play at rounders. And we could
serve up to the sun-dial here. But you want a
bat and a ball, and some more people.’</p>

<p>She struck her hands together tragically.
‘I haven’t a bat,’ she cried, ‘or a ball, or
more people, or anything sensible whatever.
Never mind; let’s play at hide-and-seek in
the kitchen-garden. And we’ll race there,
up to that walnut-tree; I haven’t run for a
century!’</p>

<p>She was so easy a victor, nevertheless, that I
began to doubt, as I panted behind, whether
she had not exaggerated her age by a year or
two. She flung herself into hide-and-seek with
all the gusto and abandonment of the true
artist; and as she flitted away and reappeared,
flushed and laughing divinely, the pale witch-maiden
seemed to fall away from her, and she
moved rather as that other girl I had read about,
snatched from fields of daffodil to reign in
shadow below, yet permitted now and again<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span>
to revisit earth and light and the frank, caressing
air.</p>

<p>Tired at last, we strolled back to the old
sun-dial, and Harold, who never relinquished
a problem unsolved, began afresh, rubbing his
finger along the faint incisions. ‘<i>Time tryeth
trothe.</i> Please, I want to know what that
means?’</p>

<p>Medea’s face drooped low over the sun-dial,
till it was almost hidden in her fingers. ‘That’s
what I’m here for,’ she said presently in quite a
changed, low voice. ‘They shut me up here—they
think I’ll forget—but I never will—never,
never! And he, too—but I don’t know—it is
so long—I don’t know!’</p>

<p>Her face was quite hidden now. There was
silence again in the old garden. I felt clumsily
helpless and awkward. Beyond a vague idea
of kicking Harold, nothing remedial seemed to
suggest itself.</p>

<p>None of us had noticed the approach of
another she-creature—one of the angular and
rigid class—how different from our dear comrade!
The years Medea had claimed might<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span>
well have belonged to her; she wore mittens,
too—a trick I detested in woman. ‘Lucy!’
she said sharply, in a tone with <i>aunt</i> writ large
over it; and Medea started up guiltily.</p>

<p>‘You’ve been crying,’ said the newcomer,
grimly regarding her through spectacles. ‘And
pray who are these exceedingly dirty little
boys?’</p>

<p>‘Friends of mine, aunt,’ said Medea promptly,
with forced cheerfulness. ‘I—I’ve known them
a long time. I asked them to come.’</p>

<p>The aunt sniffed suspiciously. ‘You must
come indoors, dear,’ she said, ‘and lie down.
The sun will give you a headache. And you
little boys had better run away home to your
tea. Remember, you should not come to pay
visits without your nursemaid.’</p>

<p>Harold had been tugging nervously at my
jacket for some time, and I only waited till
Medea turned and kissed a white hand to us
as she was led away. Then I ran. We gained
the boat in safety; and ‘What an old dragon!’
said Harold.</p>

<p>‘Wasn’t she a beast!’ I replied. ‘Fancy the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span>
sun giving any one a headache! But Medea
was a real brick. Couldn’t we carry her off?’</p>

<p>‘We could if Edward was here,’ said Harold
confidently.</p>

<p>The question was, What had become of that
defaulting hero? We were not left long in
doubt. First, there came down the lane the
shrill and wrathful clamour of a female tongue;
then Edward, running his best; and then an
excited woman hard on his heel. Edward
tumbled into the bottom of the boat, gasping
‘Shove her off!’ And shove her off we did,
mightily, while the dame abused us from the
bank in the self-same accents in which Alfred
hurled defiance at the marauding Dane.</p>

<p>‘That was just like a bit out of <i>Westward
Ho!</i>’ I remarked approvingly, as we sculled
down the stream. ‘But what had you been
doing to her?’</p>

<p>‘Hadn’t been doing anything,’ panted Edward,
still breathless. ‘I went up into the village and
explored, and it was a very nice one, and the
people were very polite. And there was a
blacksmith’s forge there, and they were shoeing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span>
horses, and the hoofs fizzled and smoked, and
smelt so jolly! I stayed there quite a long time
Then I got thirsty, so I asked that old woman
for some water, and while she was getting it her
cat came out of the cottage, and looked at me
in a nasty sort of way, and said something I
didn’t like. So I went up to it just to—to
teach it manners, and somehow or other, next
minute it was up an apple-tree, spitting, and I
was running down the lane with that old thing
after me.’</p>

<p>Edward was so full of his personal injuries
that there was no interesting him in Medea at
all. Moreover, the evening was closing in, and
it was evident that this cutting-out expedition
must be kept for another day. As we neared
home, it gradually occurred to us that perhaps
the greatest danger was yet to come; for the
farmer must have missed his boat ere now, and
would probably be lying in wait for us near the
landing-place. There was no other spot admitting
of debarcation on the home side; if we got
out on the other, and made for the bridge, we
should certainly be seen and cut off. Then it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span>
was that I blessed my stars that our elder
brother was with us that day. He might be
little good at pretending, but in grappling with
the stern facts of life he had no equal. Enjoining
silence, he waited till we were but a little
way from the fated landing-place, and then
brought us in to the opposite bank. We
scrambled out noiselessly and—the gathering
darkness favouring us—crouched behind a willow,
while Edward pushed off the empty boat
with his foot. The old Argo, borne down by the
gentle current, slid and grazed along the rushy
bank; and when she came opposite the suspected
ambush, a stream of imprecation told
us that our precaution had not been wasted.
We wondered, as we listened, where Farmer
Larkin, who was bucolically bred and reared,
had acquired such range and wealth of vocabulary.
Fully realising at last that his boat was
derelict, abandoned, at the mercy of wind and
wave—as well as out of his reach—he strode
away to the bridge, about a quarter of a mile
further down; and as soon as we heard his
boots clumping on the planks we nipped out,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span>
recovered the craft, pulled across, and made
the faithful vessel fast to her proper moorings.
Edward was anxious to wait and exchange
courtesies and compliments with the disappointed
farmer, when he should confront us
on the opposite bank; but wiser counsels
prevailed. It was possible that the piracy was
not yet laid at our particular door: Ulysses,
I reminded him, had reason to regret a similar
act of bravado, and—were he here—would
certainly advise a timely retreat. Edward held
but a low opinion of me as a counsellor; but he
had a very solid respect for Ulysses.</p>

<h2>THE ROMAN ROAD</h2>


<p class="drop-cap">ALL the roads of our neighbourhood were
cheerful and friendly, having each of
them pleasant qualities of their own; but this
one seemed different from the others in its masterful
suggestion of a serious purpose, speeding
you along with a strange uplifting of the heart.
The others tempted chiefly with their treasures
of hedge and ditch; the rapt surprise of the
first lords-and-ladies, the rustle of a field-mouse,
the splash of a frog; while cool noses of brother-beasts
were pushed at you through gate or gap.
A loiterer you had need to be, did you choose
one of them; so many were the tiny hands
thrust out to detain you, from this side and
that. But this one was of a sterner sort, and
even in its shedding off of bank and hedgerow
as it marched straight and full for the open
downs, it seemed to declare its contempt for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span>
adventitious trappings to catch the shallow-pated.
When the sense of injustice or disappointment
was heavy on me, and things were
very black within, as on this particular day, the
road of character was my choice for that solitary
ramble when I turned my back for an afternoon
on a world that had unaccountably declared
itself against me.</p>

<p>‘The Knights’ Road’ we children had named
it, from a sort of feeling that, if from any quarter
at all, it would be down this track we might some
day see Lancelot and his peers come pacing on
their great war-horses; supposing that any of
the stout band still survived, in nooks and unexplored
places. Grown-up people sometimes
spoke of it as the ‘Pilgrims’ Way’; but I
didn’t know much about pilgrims—except
Walter in the Horselberg story. Him I sometimes
saw, breaking with haggard eyes out of
yonder copse, and calling to the pilgrims as they
hurried along on their desperate march to the
Holy City, where peace and pardon were
awaiting them. ‘All roads lead to Rome,’ I
had once heard somebody say; and I had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span>
taken the remark very seriously, of course, and
puzzled over it many days. There must have
been some mistake, I concluded at last; but of
one road at least I intuitively felt it to be true.
And my belief was clinched by something that
fell from Miss Smedley during a history-lesson,
about a strange road that ran right down the
middle of England till it reached the coast, and
then began again in France, just opposite, and
so on undeviating, through city and vineyard,
right from the misty Highlands to the Eternal
City. Uncorroborated, any statement of Miss
Smedley’s usually fell on incredulous ears; but
here, with the road itself in evidence, she seemed,
once in a way, to have strayed into truth.</p>

<p>Rome! It was fascinating to think that it
lay at the other end of this white ribbon that
rolled itself off from my feet over the distant
downs. I was not quite so uninstructed as to
imagine I could reach it that afternoon; but
some day, I thought, if things went on being as
unpleasant as they were now—some day, when
Aunt Eliza had gone on a visit,—some day,
we would see.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span></p>

<p>I tried to imagine what it would be like when
I got there. The Coliseum I knew, of course,
from a woodcut in the history-book: so to
begin with I plumped that down in the middle.
The rest had to be patched up from the little
grey market-town where twice a year we went
to have our hair cut; hence, in the result,
Vespasian’s amphitheatre was approached by
muddy little streets, wherein the Red Lion and
the Blue Boar, with Somebody’s Entire along
their front, and ‘Commercial Room’ on their
windows; the doctor’s house, of substantial
red-brick; and the façade of the New Wesleyan
chapel, which we thought very fine, were the
chief architectural ornaments: while the Roman
populace pottered about in smocks and corduroys,
twisting the tails of Roman calves and
inviting each other to beer in musical Wessex.
From Rome I drifted on to other cities, faintly
heard of—Damascus, Brighton (Aunt Eliza’s
ideal), Athens, and Glasgow, whose glories the
gardener sang; but there was a certain sameness
in my conception of all of them: that
Wesleyan chapel would keep cropping up<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span>
everywhere. It was easier to go a-building
among those dream-cities where no limitations
were imposed, and one was sole architect, with
a free hand. Down a delectable street of cloud-built
palaces I was mentally pacing, when I
happened upon the Artist.</p>

<p>He was seated at work by the roadside, at a
point whence the cool large spaces of the downs,
juniper-studded, swept grandly westwards. His
attributes proclaimed him of the artist tribe:
besides, he wore knickerbockers like myself,—a
garb confined, I was aware, to boys and artists.
I knew I was not to bother him with questions,
nor look over his shoulder and breathe in his
ear—they didn’t like it, this <i>genus irritabile</i>.
But there was nothing about staring in my
code of instructions, the point having somehow
been overlooked: so, squatting down on the
grass, I devoted myself to the passionate absorbing
of every detail. At the end of five
minutes there was not a button on him that I
could not have passed an examination in; and
the wearer himself of that homespun suit was
probably less familiar with its pattern and texture<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span>
than I was. Once he looked up, nodded,
half held out his tobacco pouch, mechanically as
it were, then, returning it to his pocket, resumed
his work, and I my mental photography.</p>

<p>After another five minutes or so had passed,
he remarked, without looking my way: ‘Fine
afternoon we’re having: going far to-day?’</p>

<p>‘No, I’m not going any farther than this,’
I replied; ‘I <i>was</i> thinking of going on to Rome:
but I’ve put it off.’</p>

<p>‘Pleasant place, Rome,’ he murmured: ‘you’ll
like it.’ It was some minutes later that he
added: ‘But I wouldn’t go just now, if I were
you: too jolly hot.’</p>

<p>‘<i>You</i> haven’t been to Rome, have you?’ I
inquired.</p>

<p>‘Rather,’ he replied briefly: ‘I live there.’</p>

<p>This was too much, and my jaw dropped as
I struggled to grasp the fact that I was sitting
there talking to a fellow who lived in Rome.
Speech was out of the question: besides I had
other things to do. Ten solid minutes had I
already spent in an examination of him as a
mere stranger and artist; and now the whole<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span>
thing had to be done over again, from the
changed point of view. So I began afresh, at
the crown of his soft hat, and worked down
to his solid British shoes, this time investing
everything with the new Roman halo; and at
last I managed to get out: ‘But you don’t
really live there, do you?’ never doubting the
fact, but wanting to hear it repeated.</p>

<p>‘Well,’ he said, good-naturedly overlooking
the slight rudeness of my query, ‘I live there
as much as I live anywhere. About half the
year sometimes. I’ve got a sort of a shanty
there. You must come and see it some day.’</p>

<p>‘But do you live anywhere else as well?’ I
went on, feeling the forbidden tide of questions
surging up within me.</p>

<p>‘O yes, all over the place,’ was his vague
reply. ‘And I’ve got a diggings somewhere
off Piccadilly.’</p>

<p>‘Where’s that?’ I inquired.</p>

<p>‘Where’s what?’ said he. ‘O, Piccadilly!
It’s in London.’</p>

<p>‘Have you a large garden?’ I asked; ‘and
how many pigs have you got?’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span></p>

<p>‘I’ve no garden at all,’ he replied sadly, and
they don’t allow me to keep pigs, though I’d
like to, awfully. It’s very hard.’</p>

<p>‘But what do you do all day, then,’ I cried,
‘and where do you go and play, without any
garden, or pigs, or things?’</p>

<p>‘When I want to play,’ he said gravely, ‘I
have to go and play in the street; but it’s poor
fun, I grant you. There’s a goat, though, not
far off, and sometimes I talk to him when I’m
feeling lonely; but he’s very proud.’</p>

<p>‘Goats <i>are</i> proud,’ I admitted. ‘There’s one
lives near here, and if you say anything to him
at all, he hits you in the wind with his head.
You know what it feels like when a fellow hits
you in the wind?’</p>

<p>‘I do, well,’ he replied, in a tone of proper
melancholy, and painted on.</p>

<p>‘And have you been to any other places,’
I began again presently, ‘besides Rome and
Piccy-what’s-his-name?’</p>

<p>‘Heaps,’ he said. ‘I’m a sort of Ulysses—seen
men and cities, you know. In fact, about the
only place I never got to was the Fortunate Island.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span></p>

<p>I began to like this man. He answered your
questions briefly and to the point, and never
tried to be funny. I felt I could be confidential
with him.</p>

<p>‘Wouldn’t you like,’ I inquired, ‘to find a
city without any people in it at all?’</p>

<p>He looked puzzled. ‘I’m afraid I don’t
quite understand,’ said he.</p>

<p>‘I mean,’ I went on eagerly, ‘a city where
you walk in at the gates, and the shops are all
full of beautiful things, and the houses furnished
as grand as can be, and there isn’t anybody
there whatever! And you go into the shops,
and take anything you want—chocolates and
magic-lanterns and injirubber balls—and there’s
nothing to pay; and you choose your own house
and live there and do just as you like, and never
go to bed unless you want to!’</p>

<p>The artist laid down his brush. ‘That <i>would</i>
be a nice city,’ he said. ‘Better than Rome.
You can’t do that sort of thing in Rome—or in
Piccadilly either. But I fear it’s one of the
places I’ve never been to.’</p>

<p>‘And you’d ask your friends,’ I went on,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span>
warming to my subject; ‘only those you really
like, of course; and they’d each have a house
to themselves—there’d be lots of houses,—and
there wouldn’t be any relations at all, unless
they promised they’d be pleasant; and if they
weren’t they’d have to go.’</p>

<p>‘So you wouldn’t have any relations?’ said
the artist. ‘Well, perhaps you’re right. We
have tastes in common, I see.’</p>

<p>‘I’d have Harold,’ I said reflectively, ‘and
Charlotte. They’d like it awfully. The others
are getting too old. O, and Martha—I’d have
Martha to cook and wash up and do things.
You’d like Martha. She’s ever so much nicer
than Aunt Eliza. She’s my idea of a real
lady.’</p>

<p>‘Then I’m sure I should like her,’ he replied
heartily, ‘and when I come to—what do you
call this city of yours? Nephelo—something,
did you say?’</p>

<p>‘I—I don’t know,’ I replied timidly. ‘I’m
afraid it hasn’t got a name—yet.’</p>

<p>The artist gazed out over the downs. ‘“The
poet says, dear city of Cecrops,”’ he said softly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span>
to himself, ‘“and wilt not thou say, dear city
of Zeus?” That’s from Marcus Aurelius,’ he
went on, turning again to his work. ‘You don’t
know him, I suppose; you will some day.’</p>

<p>‘Who’s he?’ I inquired.</p>

<p>‘O, just another fellow who lived in Rome,’
he replied, dabbing away.</p>

<p>‘O dear!’ I cried disconsolately. ‘What a
lot of people seem to live at Rome, and I’ve
never even been there! But I think I’d like
<i>my</i> city best.’</p>

<p>‘And so would I,’ he replied with unction.
‘But Marcus Aurelius wouldn’t, you know.’</p>

<p>‘Then we won’t invite him,’ I said; ‘will
we?’</p>

<p>‘<i>I</i> won’t if you won’t,’ said he. And that
point being settled, we were silent for a while.</p>

<p>‘Do you know,’ he said presently, ‘I’ve met
one or two fellows from time to time, who have
been to a city like yours—perhaps it was the
same one. They won’t talk much about it—only
broken hints, now and then; but they’ve
been there sure enough. They don’t seem to
care about anything in particular—and everything’s<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span>
the same to them, rough or smooth;
and sooner or later they slip off and disappear;
and you never see them again. Gone back, I
suppose.’</p>

<p>‘Of course,’ said I. ‘Don’t see what they
ever came away for; <i>I</i> wouldn’t. To be told
you’ve broken things when you haven’t, and
stopped having tea with the servants in the
kitchen, and not allowed to have a dog to sleep
with you. But <i>I’ve</i> known people, too, who’ve
gone there.’</p>

<p>The artist stared, but without incivility.</p>

<p>‘Well, there’s Lancelot,’ I went on. ‘The
book says he died, but it never seemed to read
right, somehow. He just went away, like
Arthur. And Crusoe, when he got tired of
wearing clothes and being respectable. And
all the nice men in the stories who don’t marry
the Princess, ’cos only one man ever gets married
in a book, you know. They’ll be there!’</p>

<p>‘And the men who never come off,’ he said,
‘who try like the rest, but get knocked out, or
somehow miss—or break down or get bowled
over in the melée—and get no Princess, nor<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span>
even a second-class kingdom—some of them’ll
be there, I hope?’</p>

<p>‘Yes, if you like,’ I replied, not quite understanding
him; ‘if they’re friends of yours, we’ll
ask ’em, of course.’</p>

<p>‘What a time we shall have!’ said the artist
reflectively; ‘and how shocked old Marcus
Aurelius will be!’</p>

<p>The shadows had lengthened uncannily, a
tide of golden haze was flooding the grey-green
surface of the downs, and the artist began to put
his traps together, preparatory to a move. I felt
very low: we would have to part, it seemed,
just as we were getting on so well together.
Then he stood up, and he was very straight and
tall, and the sunset was in his hair and beard
as he stood there, high over me. He took my
hand like an equal. ‘I’ve enjoyed our conversation
very much,’ he said. ‘That was an
interesting subject you started, and we haven’t
half exhausted it. We shall meet again, I
hope?’</p>

<p>‘Of course we shall,’ I replied, surprised that
there should be any doubt about it.</p>

<div class="caption">“THEN HE STOOD UP, AND HE WAS VERY STRAIGHT<br>
AND TALL, AND THE SUNSET WAS IN HIS HAIR AND<br>
BEARD AS HE STOOD THERE, HIGH OVER ME”</div>
</div>

<p>‘In Rome perhaps?’ said he.</p>

<p>‘Yes, in Rome,’ I answered; ‘or Piccy-the-other-place,
or somewhere.’</p>

<p>‘Or else,’ said he, ‘in that other city—when
we’ve found the way there. And I’ll look out
for you, and you’ll sing out as soon as you see
me. And we’ll go down the street arm-in-arm,
and into all the shops, and then I’ll choose my
house, and you’ll choose your house, and we’ll
live there like princes and good fellows.’</p>

<p>‘O, but you’ll stay in my house, won’t
you?’ I cried; ‘I wouldn’t ask everybody;
but I’ll ask <i>you</i>.’</p>

<p>He affected to consider a moment; then
‘Right!’ he said: ‘I believe you mean it, and
I <i>will</i> come and stay with you. I won’t go to
anybody else, if they ask me ever so much.
And I’ll stay quite a long time, too, and I
won’t be any trouble.’</p>

<p>Upon this compact we parted, and I went
down-heartedly from the man who understood
me, back to the house where I never could do
anything right. How was it that everything
seemed natural and sensible to him, which these<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span>
uncles, vicars, and other grown-up men took
for the merest tomfoolery? Well, he would
explain this, and many another thing, when
we met again. The Knights’ Road! How it
always brought consolation! Was he possibly
one of those vanished knights I had been looking
for so long? Perhaps he would be in
armour next time—why not? He would look
well in armour, I thought. And I would take
care to get there first, and see the sunlight flash
and play on his helmet and shield, as he rode up
the High Street of the Golden City.</p>

<p>Meantime, there only remained the finding it.
An easy matter.</p>

<h2>THE SECRET DRAWER</h2>


<p class="drop-cap">IT must surely have served as a boudoir for
the ladies of old time, this little used, rarely
entered chamber where the neglected old bureau
stood. There was something very feminine in
the faint hues of its faded brocades, in the rose
and blue of such bits of china as yet remained,
and in the delicate old-world fragrance of pot-pourri
from the great bowl,—blue and white,
with funny holes in its cover,—that stood on
the bureau’s flat top. Modern aunts disdained
this out-of-the-way, backwater, upstairs room,
preferring to do their accounts and grapple
with their correspondence in some central position
more in the whirl of things, whence one
eye could be kept on the carriage-drive, while
the other was alert for malingering servants and
marauding children. Those aunts of a former<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span>
generation—I sometimes felt—would have
suited our habits better. But even by us
children, to whom few places were private or
reserved, the room was visited but rarely. To
be sure, there was nothing particular in it that
we coveted or required. Only a few spindle-legged,
gilt-backed chairs,—an old harp on
which, so the legend ran, Aunt Eliza herself
used once to play, in years remote, unchronicled;
a corner-cupboard with a few pieces of china;
and the old bureau. But one other thing the
room possessed, peculiar to itself; a certain
sense of privacy—a power of making the
intruder feel that he <i>was</i> intruding—perhaps
even a faculty of hinting that some one might
have been sitting on those chairs, writing at the
bureau, or fingering the china, just a second
before one entered. No such violent word as
‘haunted’ could possibly apply to this pleasant
old-fashioned chamber, which indeed we all
rather liked; but there was no doubt it was reserved
and stand-offish, keeping itself to itself.</p>

<p>Uncle Thomas was the first to draw my
attention to the possibilities of the old bureau.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span>
He was pottering about the house one afternoon,
having ordered me to keep at his heels for
company—he was a man who hated to be left
one minute alone,—when his eye fell on it.
‘H’m! Sheraton!’ he remarked. (He had a
smattering of most things, this uncle, especially
the vocabularies.) Then he let down the flap,
and examined the empty pigeon-holes and
dusty panelling. ‘Fine bit of inlay,’ he went
on: ‘good work, all of it. I know the sort.
There’s a secret drawer in there somewhere.’
Then as I breathlessly drew near, he suddenly
exclaimed: ‘By Jove, I do want to smoke!’
And, wheeling round, he abruptly fled for the
garden, leaving me with the cup dashed from my
lips. What a strange thing, I mused, was this
smoking, that takes a man suddenly, be he in
the court, the camp, or the grove, grips him like
an Afreet, and whirls him off to do its imperious
behests! Would it be even so with myself, I
wondered, in those unknown grown-up years
to come?</p>

<p>But I had no time to waste in vain speculations.
My whole being was still vibrating to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span>
those magic syllables ‘secret drawer’; and that
particular chord had been touched that never
fails to thrill responsive to such words as <i>cave</i>,
<i>trap-door</i>, <i>sliding-panel</i>, <i>bullion</i>, <i>ingots</i>, or
<i>Spanish dollars</i>. For, besides its own special
bliss, who ever heard of a secret drawer with
nothing in it? And O I did want money so
badly! I mentally ran over the list of demands
which were pressing me the most imperiously.</p>

<p>First, there was the pipe I wanted to give
George Jannaway. George, who was Martha’s
young man, was a shepherd, and a great ally of
mine; and the last fair he was at, when he
bought his sweetheart fairings, as a right-minded
shepherd should, he had purchased a lovely
snake expressly for me; one of the wooden
sort, with joints, waggling deliciously in the
hand; with yellow spots on a green ground,
sticky and strong-smelling, as a fresh-painted
snake ought to be; and with a red-flannel
tongue pasted cunningly into its jaws. I loved
it much, and took it to bed with me every night,
till what time its spinal cord was loosed and it
fell apart, and went the way of all mortal joys.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span>
<i>I</i> thought it very nice of George to think of me
at the fair, and that’s why I wanted to give him
a pipe. When the young year was chill and
lambing-time was on, George inhabited a little
wooden house on wheels, far out on the wintry
downs, and saw no faces but such as were
sheepish and woolly and mute; and when he
and Martha were married, she was going to
carry his dinner out to him every day, two
miles; and after it, perhaps he would smoke my
pipe. It seemed an idyllic sort of existence, for
both the parties concerned; but a pipe of quality,
a pipe fitted to be part of a life such as this,
could not be procured (so Martha informed me)
for a smaller sum than eighteenpence. And
meantime——!</p>

<p>Then there was the fourpence I owed Edward;
not that he was bothering me for it, but
I knew he was in need of it himself, to pay back
Selina, who wanted it to make up a sum of two
shillings, to buy Harold an ironclad for his
approaching birthday,—H.M.S. <i>Majestic</i>, now
lying uselessly careened in the toyshop window,
just when her country had such sore need of her.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span></p>

<p>And then there was that boy in the village
who had caught a young squirrel, and I had
never yet possessed one, and he wanted a shilling
for it, but I knew that for ninepence in cash—but
what was the good of these sorry threadbare
reflections? I had wants enough to exhaust
any possible find of bullion, even if it amounted
to half a sovereign. My only hope now lay in
the magic drawer, and here I was, standing and
letting the precious minutes slip by! Whether
‘findings’ of this sort could, morally speaking,
be considered ‘keepings,’ was a point that did
not occur to me.</p>

<p>The room was very still as I approached the
bureau; possessed, it seemed to be, by a sort
of hush of expectation. The faint odour of
orris-root that floated forth as I let down the
flap, seemed to identify itself with the yellows
and browns of the old wood, till hue and scent
were of one quality and interchangeable. Even
so, ere this, the pot-pourri had mixed itself with
the tints of the old brocade, and brocade and
pot-pourri had long been one. With expectant
fingers I explored the empty pigeon-holes and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span>
sounded the depths of the softly-sliding drawers.
No books that I knew of gave any general recipe
for a quest like this; but the glory, should I
succeed unaided, would be all the greater.</p>

<p>To him who is destined to arrive, the fates
never fail to afford, on the way, their small
encouragements. In less than two minutes, I
had come across a rusty button-hook. This was
truly magnificent. In the nursery there existed,
indeed, a general button-hook, common to either
sex; but none of us possessed a private and
special button-hook, to lend or to refuse as
suited the high humour of the moment. I
pocketed the treasure carefully, and proceeded.
At the back of another drawer, three old foreign
stamps told me I was surely on the highroad to
fortune.</p>

<p>Following on these bracing incentives, came
a dull blank period of unrewarded search. In
vain I removed all the drawers and felt over
every inch of the smooth surfaces, from front
to back. Never a knob, spring or projection
met the thrilling finger-tips; unyielding the old
bureau stood, stoutly guarding its secret, if<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span>
secret it really had. I began to grow weary
and disheartened. This was not the first time
that Uncle Thomas had proved shallow, uninformed,
a guide into blind alleys where the
echoes mocked you. Was it any good persisting
longer? Was anything any good whatever?
In my mind I began to review past disappointments,
and life seemed one long record of
failure and of non-arrival. Disillusioned and
depressed, I left my work and went to the
window. The light was ebbing from the room,
and seemed outside to be collecting itself on
the horizon for its concentrated effort of sunset.
Far down the garden, Uncle Thomas was holding
Edward in the air reversed, and smacking
him. Edward, gurgling hysterically, was striking
blind fists in the direction where he judged
his uncle’s stomach should rightly be; the contents
of his pockets—a motley show—were
strewing the lawn. Somehow, though I had
been put through a similar performance myself
an hour or two ago, it all seemed very far away
and cut off from me.</p>

<div class="caption">“WESTWARD THE CLOUDS WERE MASSING THEMSELVES IN A LOW<br>
VIOLET BANK; BELOW THEM, TO NORTH AND SOUTH, AS FAR<br>
ROUND AS THE EYE COULD REACH, A NARROW STREAK OF<br>
GOLD RAN OUT .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. I TURNED FOR A LAST EFFORT”</div>
</div>

<p>Westwards the clouds were massing themselves<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span>
in a low violet bank; below them, to
north and south, as far round as eye could
reach, a narrow streak of gold ran out and
stretched away, straight along the horizon.
Somewhere very far off, a horn was blowing,
clear and thin; it sounded like the golden streak
grown audible, while the gold seemed the visible
sound. It pricked my ebbing courage, this
blended strain of music and colour. I turned
for a last effort; and Fortune thereupon, as if
half-ashamed of the unworthy game she had been
playing with me, relented, opening her clenched
fist. Hardly had I put my hand once more to
the obdurate wood, when with a sort of small
sigh, almost a sob—as it were—of relief, the
secret drawer sprang open.</p>

<p>I drew it out and carried it to the window,
to examine it in the failing light. Too hopeless
had I gradually grown, in my dispiriting search,
to expect very much; and yet at a glance I saw
that my basket of glass lay in shivers at my
feet. No ingots nor dollars were here, to crown
me the little Monte Cristo of a week. Outside,
the distant horn had ceased its gnat-song, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span>
gold was paling to primrose, and everything
was lonely and still. Within, my confident
little castles were tumbling down like so many
card-houses, leaving me stripped of estate,
both real and personal, and dominated by the
depressing reaction.</p>

<p>And yet,—as I looked again at the small
collection that lay within that drawer of disillusions,
some warmth crept back to my heart
as I recognised that a kindred spirit to my own
had been at the making of it. Two tarnished
gilt buttons—naval, apparently—a portrait of a
monarch unknown to me, cut from some antique
print and deftly coloured by hand in just my
own bold style of brush-work—some foreign
copper coins, thicker and clumsier of make than
those I hoarded myself—and a list of birds’-eggs,
with names of the places where they had
been found. Also, a ferret’s muzzle, and a
twist of tarry string, still faintly aromatic! It
was a real boy’s hoard, then, that I had
happened upon. He too had found out the
secret drawer, this happy-starred young person;
and here he had stowed away his treasures, one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span>
by one, and had cherished them secretly awhile,
and then—what? Well, one would never know
now the reason why these priceless possessions
still lay here unreclaimed; but across the void
stretch of years I seemed to touch hands a
moment with my little comrade of seasons—how
many seasons?—long since dead.</p>

<p>I restored the drawer, with its contents, to
the trusty bureau, and heard the spring click
with a certain satisfaction. Some other boy,
perhaps, would some day release that spring
again. I trusted he would be equally appreciative.
As I opened the door to go, I could
hear, from the nursery at the end of the passage,
shouts and yells, telling that the hunt was up.
Bears, apparently, or bandits, were on the
evening bill of fare, judging by the character of
the noises. In another minute I would be in
the thick of it, in all the warmth and light and
laughter. And yet—what a long way off it all
seemed, both in space and time, to me yet
lingering on the threshold of that old-world
chamber!</p>

<h2>‘EXIT TYRANNUS’</h2>


<p class="drop-cap">THE eventful day had arrived at last, the
day which, when first named, had seemed—like
all golden dates that promise anything
definite—so immeasurably remote. When it
was first announced, a fortnight before, that
Miss Smedley was really going, the resultant
ecstasies had occupied a full week, during which
we blindly revelled in the contemplation and
discussion of her past tyrannies, crimes, malignities;
in recalling to each other this or that
insult, dishonour, or physical assault, sullenly
endured at a time when deliverance was not even
a small star on the horizon: and in mapping out
the shining days to come, with special new
troubles of their own, no doubt—since this is
but a work-a-day world!—but at least free from
one familiar scourge. The time that remained
had been taken up by the planning of practical
expressions of the popular sentiment. Under<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span>
Edward’s masterly direction, arrangements had
been made for a flag to be run up over the hen-house
at the very moment when the fly, with
Miss Smedley’s boxes on top and the grim
oppressor herself inside, began to move off
down the drive. Three brass cannons, set on
the brow of the sunk-fence, were to proclaim
our deathless sentiments in the ears of the
retreating foe; the dogs were to wear ribbons;
and later—but this depended on our powers of
evasiveness and dissimulation—there might be
a small bonfire, with a cracker or two if the
public funds could bear the unwonted strain.</p>

<p>I was awakened by Harold digging me in
the ribs, and ‘She’s going to-day!’ was the
morning hymn that scattered the clouds of
sleep. Strange to say, it was with no corresponding
jubilation of spirits that I slowly
realised the momentous fact. Indeed, as I
dressed, a dull disagreeable feeling that I could
not define grew up in me—something like a
physical bruise. Harold was evidently feeling
it too, for after repeating ‘She’s going to-day!’
in a tone more befitting the Litany, he looked<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span>
hard in my face for direction as to how the
situation was to be taken. But I crossly bade
him look sharp and say his prayers and not
bother me. What could this gloom portend,
that on a day of days like the present seemed
to hang my heavens with black?</p>

<p>Down at last and out in the sun, we found
Edward before us, swinging on a gate and
chanting a farm-yard ditty in which all the
beasts appear in due order, jargoning in their
several tongues, and every verse begins with
the couplet:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
  <div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">‘Now, my lads, come with me,</div>
<div class="verse">&nbsp;Out in the morning early!’</div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="unindent">The fateful exodus of the day had evidently
slipped his memory entirely. I touched him
on the shoulder. ‘She’s going to-day!’ I said.
Edward’s carol subsided like a water-tap turned
off. ‘So she is!’ he replied, and got down
at once off the gate. And we returned to the
house without another word.</p>

<p>At breakfast Miss Smedley behaved in a
most mean and uncalled-for manner. The
right divine of governesses to govern wrong<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span>
includes no right to cry. In thus usurping
the prerogative of their victims they ignore
the rules of the ring, and hit below the belt.
Charlotte was crying, of course; but that
counted for nothing. Charlotte even cried
when the pigs’ noses were ringed in due season;
thereby evoking the cheery contempt of the
operators, who asserted they liked it, and doubtless
knew. But when the cloud-compeller, her
bolts laid aside, resorted to tears, mutinous
humanity had a right to feel aggrieved, and
think itself placed in a false and difficult
position. What would the Romans have done,
supposing Hannibal had cried? History has
not even considered the possibility. Rules and
precedents should be strictly observed on both
sides. When they are violated, the other party
is justified in feeling injured.</p>

<p>There were no lessons that morning, naturally—another
grievance! The fitness of things
required that we should have struggled to the
last in a confused medley of moods and tenses,
and parted for ever, flushed with hatred, over
the dismembered corpse of the multiplication<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span>-table.
But this thing was not to be; and I
was free to stroll by myself through the garden,
and combat, as best I might, this growing
feeling of depression. It was a wrong system
altogether, I thought, this going of people one
had got used to. Things ought always to
continue as they had been. Change there
must be, of course; pigs, for instance, came
and went with disturbing frequency—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
  <div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">‘Fired their ringing shot and passed,</div>
<div class="verse">&nbsp;Hotly charged and sank at last’—</div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="unindent">but Nature had ordered it so, and in requital
had provided for rapid successors. Did you
come to love a pig, and he was taken from
you, grief was quickly assuaged in the delight
of selection from the new litter. But now,
when it was no question of a peerless pig, but
only of a governess, Nature seemed helpless, and
the future held no litter of oblivion. Things
might be better, or they might be worse, but
they would never be the same; and the innate
conservatism of youth asks neither poverty nor
riches, but only immunity from change.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span></p>

<p>Edward slouched up alongside of me presently,
with a hangdog look on him, as if he
had been caught stealing jam. ‘What a lark
it’ll be when she’s really gone!’ he observed,
with a swagger obviously assumed.</p>

<p>‘Grand fun!’ I replied dolorously; and conversation
flagged.</p>

<p>We reached the hen-house, and contemplated
the banner of freedom lying ready to flaunt the
breezes at the supreme moment.</p>

<p>‘Shall you run it up,’ I asked, ‘when the fly
starts, or—or wait a little till it’s out of
sight?’</p>

<p>Edward gazed round him dubiously. ‘We’re
going to have some rain, I think,’ he said; ‘and—and
it’s a new flag. It would be a pity to
spoil it. P’raps I won’t run it up at all.’</p>

<p>Harold came round the corner like a bison
pursued by Indians. ‘I’ve polished up the
cannons,’ he cried, ‘and they look grand!
Mayn’t I load ’em now?’</p>

<p>‘You leave ’em alone,’ said Edward severely,
‘or you’ll be blowing yourself up’ (consideration
for others was not usually Edward’s strong<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span>
point). ‘Don’t touch the gunpowder till you’re
told, or you’ll get your head smacked.’</p>

<p>Harold fell behind, limp, squashed, obedient.
‘She wants me to write to her,’ he began presently.
‘Says she doesn’t mind the spelling, if
I’ll only write. Fancy her saying that!’</p>

<p>‘O, shut up, will you?’ said Edward
savagely; and once more we were silent, with
only our thoughts for sorry company.</p>

<p>‘Let’s go off to the copse,’ I suggested
timidly, feeling that something had to be done
to relieve the tension, ‘and cut more new bows
and arrows.’</p>

<p>‘She gave me a knife my last birthday,’ said
Edward moodily, never budging. ‘It wasn’t
much of a knife—but I wish I hadn’t lost it!’</p>

<p>‘When my legs used to ache,’ I said, ‘she
sat up half the night, rubbing stuff on them. I
forgot all about that till this morning.’</p>

<p>‘There’s the fly!’ cried Harold suddenly.
‘I can hear it scrunching on the gravel.’</p>

<p>Then for the first time we turned and stared
each other in the face.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span></p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>The fly and its contents had finally disappeared
through the gate, the rumble of its
wheels had died away. Yet no flag floated
defiantly in the sun, no cannons proclaimed the
passing of a dynasty. From out the frosted
cake of our existence Fate had cut an irreplaceable
segment: turn which way we would, the
void was present. We sneaked off in different
directions, mutually undesirous of company;
and it seemed borne in upon me that I ought
to go and dig my garden right over, from end
to end. It didn’t actually want digging; on
the other hand no amount of digging could
affect it, for good or for evil; so I worked
steadily, strenuously, under the hot sun, stifling
thought in action. At the end of an hour or
so, I was joined by Edward.</p>

<div class="caption">“‘I’VE BEEN CHOPPING UP WOOD,’ HE<br>
EXPLAINED, IN A GUILTY SORT OF WAY”</div>
</div>

<p>‘I’ve been chopping up wood,’ he explained,
in a guilty sort of way, though nobody had
called on him to account for his doings.</p>

<p>‘What for?’ I inquired stupidly. ‘There’s
piles and piles of it chopped up already.’</p>

<p>‘I know,’ said Edward, ‘but there’s no harm
in having a bit over. You never can tell what<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a></span>
may happen. But what have you been doing
all this digging for?’</p>

<p>‘You said it was going to rain,’ I explained
hastily. ‘So I thought I’d get the digging
done before it came. Good gardeners always
tell you that’s the right thing to do.’</p>

<p>‘It did look like rain at one time,’ Edward
admitted; ‘but it’s passed off now. Very queer
weather we’re having. I suppose that’s why
I’ve felt so funny all day.’</p>

<p>‘Yes, I suppose it’s the weather,’ I replied.
‘<i>I’ve</i> been feeling funny too.’</p>

<p>The weather had nothing to do with it, as
we well knew. But we would both have died
rather than admit the real reason.</p>

<h2>THE BLUE ROOM</h2>


<p class="drop-cap">THAT nature has her moments of sympathy
with man has been noted often enough,—and
generally as a new discovery. To us,
who had never known any other condition of
things, it seemed entirely right and fitting that
the wind sang and sobbed in the poplar tops,
and, in the lulls of it, sudden spirts of rain
spattered the already dusty roads, on that blusterous
March day when Edward and I awaited,
on the station platform, the arrival of the new
tutor. Needless to say, this arrangement had
been planned by an aunt, from some fond idea
that our shy, innocent young natures would
unfold themselves during the walk from the
station, and that, on the revelation of each
other’s more solid qualities that must inevitably
ensue, an enduring friendship, springing from
mutual respect, might be firmly based. A<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span>
pretty dream,—nothing more. For Edward,
who foresaw that the brunt of tutorial oppression
would have to be borne by him, was sulky,
monosyllabic, and determined to be as negatively
disagreeable as good manners would permit. It
was therefore evident that I would have to be
spokesman and purveyor of hollow civilities, and
I was none the more amiable on that account;
all courtesies, welcomes, explanations, and other
court-chamberlain kind of business, being my
special aversion. There was much of the tempestuous
March weather in the hearts of both of
us, as we sullenly glowered along the carriage-windows
of the slackening train.</p>

<p>One is apt, however, to misjudge the special
difficulties of a situation; and the reception
proved, after all, an easy and informal matter.
In a trainful so uniformly bucolic, a tutor was
readily recognisable; and his portmanteau had
been consigned to the luggage-cart, and his
person conveyed into the lane, before I had
discharged one of my carefully considered
sentences. I breathed more easily, and looking
up at our new friend as we stepped out together,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span>
remembered that we had been counting on
something altogether more arid, scholastic, and
severe. A boyish eager face and a petulant
<i>pince-nez</i>—untidy hair—a head of constant
quick turns like a robin’s, and a voice that kept
breaking into alto—these were all very strange
and new, but not in the least terrible.</p>

<p>He proceeded jerkily through the village, with
glances on this side and that; and ‘Charming,’
he broke out presently; ‘quite too charming
and delightful!’</p>

<p>I had not counted on this sort of thing, and
glanced for help to Edward, who, hands in
pockets, looked grimly down his nose. He had
taken his line, and meant to stick to it.</p>

<p>Meantime our friend had made an imaginary
spy-glass out of his fist, and was squinting
through it at something I could not perceive.
‘What an exquisite bit!’ he burst out. ‘Fifteenth
century—no—yes it is!’</p>

<p>I began to feel puzzled, not to say alarmed.
It reminded me of the butcher in the <i>Arabian
Nights</i>, whose common joints, displayed on the
shop-front, took to a startled public the appearance<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a></span>
of dismembered humanity. This man
seemed to see the strangest things in our dull,
familiar surroundings.</p>

<p>‘Ah!’ he broke out again, as we jogged on
between hedgerows: ‘and that field now—backed
by the downs—with the rain-cloud
brooding over it,—that’s all David Cox—every
bit of it!’</p>

<p>‘That field belongs to Farmer Larkin,’ I
explained politely; for of course he could not
be expected to know. ‘I’ll take you over to
Farmer Cox’s to-morrow, if he’s a friend of
yours; but there‘s nothing to see there.’</p>

<p>Edward, who was hanging sullenly behind,
made a face at me, as if to say, ‘What sort of
lunatic have we got here?’</p>

<p>‘It has the true pastoral character, this
country of yours,’ went on our enthusiast: ‘with
just that added touch in cottage and farmstead,
relics of a bygone art, which makes our English
landscape so divine, so unique!’</p>

<p>Really this grasshopper was becoming a
burden! These familiar fields and farms, of
which we knew every blade and stick, had done<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a></span>
nothing that I knew of to be bespattered with
adjectives in this way. I had never thought of
them as divine, unique, or anything else. They
were—well, they were just themselves, and
there was an end of it. Despairingly I jogged
Edward in the ribs, as a sign to start rational
conversation, but he only grinned and continued
obdurate.</p>

<p>‘You can see the house now,’ I remarked
presently; ‘and that’s Selina, chasing the
donkey in the paddock. Or is it the donkey
chasing Selina? I can’t quite make out; but
it’s <i>them</i>, anyhow.’</p>

<p>Needless to say, he exploded with a full
charge of adjectives. ‘Exquisite!’ he rapped
out; ‘so mellow and harmonious! and so
entirely in keeping!’ (I could see from Edward’s
face that he was thinking who ought to
be in keeping.) ‘Such possibilities of romance,
now, in those old gables!’</p>

<p>‘If you mean the garrets,’ I said, ‘there’s a
lot of old furniture in them; and one is generally
full of apples; and the bats get in sometimes,
under the eaves, and flop about till we go up<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span>
with hair-brushes and things and drive ’em
out; but there’s nothing else in them that I
know of.’</p>

<p>‘O, but there must be more than bats,’ he
cried. ‘Don’t tell me there are no ghosts. I
shall be deeply disappointed if there aren’t any
ghosts.’</p>

<p>I did not think it worth while to reply, feeling
really unequal to this sort of conversation.
Besides, we were nearing the house, when my
task would be ended. Aunt Eliza met us at
the door, and in the cross-fire of adjectives that
ensued—both of them talking at once, as
grown-up folk have a habit of doing—we two
slipped round to the back of the house, and
speedily put several broad acres between us and
civilisation, for fear of being ordered in to tea in
the drawing-room. By the time we returned,
our new importation had gone up to dress for
dinner, so till the morrow at least we were free
of him.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the March wind, after dropping a
while at sundown, had been steadily increasing
in volume; and although I fell asleep at my<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[211]</a></span>
usual hour, about midnight I was wakened by
the stress and the cry of it. In the bright moonlight,
wind-swung branches tossed and swayed
eerily across the blinds; there was rumbling in
chimneys, whistling in keyholes, and everywhere
a clamour and a call. Sleep was out of
the question, and, sitting up in bed, I looked
round. Edward sat up too. ‘I was wondering
when you were going to wake,’ he said. ‘It’s
no good trying to sleep through this. I vote
we get up and do something.’</p>

<p>‘I’m game,’ I replied. ‘Let’s play at being
in a ship at sea’ (the plaint of the old house
under the buffeting wind suggested this, naturally);
‘and we can be wrecked on an island,
or left on a raft, whichever you choose; but I
like an island best myself, because there’s more
things on it.’</p>

<p>Edward on reflection negatived the idea. ‘It
would make too much noise,’ he pointed out.
‘There’s no fun playing at ships, unless you
can make a jolly good row.’</p>

<p>The door creaked, and a small figure in white
slipped cautiously in. ‘Thought I heard you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a></span>
talking,’ said Charlotte. ‘We don’t like it;
we’re afraid—Selina too! She’ll be here in a
minute. She’s putting on her new dressing-gown
she’s so proud of.’</p>

<p>His arms round his knees, Edward cogitated
deeply until Selina appeared, barefooted, and
looking slim and tall in the new dressing-gown.
Then, ‘Look here,’ he exclaimed; ‘now we’re
all together, I vote we go and explore!’</p>

<p>‘You’re always wanting to explore,’ I said.
‘What on earth is there to explore for in this
house?’</p>

<p>‘Biscuits!’ said the inspired Edward.</p>

<p>‘Hooray! Come on!’ chimed in Harold,
sitting up suddenly. He had been awake all
the time, but had been shamming asleep, lest
he should be fagged to do anything.</p>

<p>It was indeed a fact, as Edward had remembered,
that our thoughtless elders occasionally
left the biscuits out, a prize for the night-walking
adventurer with nerves of steel.</p>

<p>Edward tumbled out of bed, and pulled a
baggy old pair of knickerbockers over his bare
shanks. Then he girt himself with a belt, into<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[213]</a></span>
which he thrust, on the one side a large wooden
pistol, on the other an old single-stick; and
finally he donned a big slouch-hat—once an
uncle’s—that we used for playing Guy Fawkes
and Charles-the-Second-up-a-tree in. Whatever
the audience, Edward, if possible, always
dressed for his parts with care and conscientiousness;
while Harold and I, true Elizabethans,
cared little about the mounting of the
piece, so long as the real dramatic heart of it
beat sound.</p>

<p>Our commander now enjoined on us a silence
deep as the grave, reminding us that Aunt Eliza
usually slept with an open door, past which we
had to file.</p>

<p>‘But we’ll take the short cut through the
Blue Room,’ said the wary Selina.</p>

<p>‘Of course,’ said Edward approvingly. ‘I forgot
about that. Now then! You lead the way!’</p>

<p>The Blue Room had in prehistoric times been
added to by taking in a superfluous passage, and
so not only had the advantage of two doors, but
also enabled us to get to the head of the stairs
without passing the chamber wherein our dragon-aunt<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a></span>
lay couched. It was rarely occupied,
except when a casual uncle came down for the
night. We entered in noiseless file, the room
being plunged in darkness, except for a bright
strip of moonlight on the floor, across which we
must pass for our exit. On this our leading
lady chose to pause, seizing the opportunity
to study the hang of her new dressing-gown.
Greatly satisfied thereat, she proceeded, after
the feminine fashion, to peacock and to pose,
pacing a minuet down the moonlit patch with
an imaginary partner. This was too much for
Edward’s histrionic instincts, and after a
moment’s pause he drew his single-stick, and,
with flourishes meet for the occasion, strode on
to the stage. A struggle ensued on approved
lines, at the end of which Selina was stabbed
slowly and with unction, and her corpse borne
from the chamber by the ruthless cavalier.
The rest of us rushed after in a clump, with
capers and gesticulations of delight; the special
charm of the performance lying in the necessity
for its being carried out with the dumbest of
dumb shows.</p>

<div class="caption">“WE ENTERED IN NOISELESS FILE, THE ROOM<br>
BEING PLUNGED IN DARKNESS, EXCEPT FOR A<br>
BRIGHT STRIP OF MOONLIGHT ON THE FLOOR”</div>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[215]</a></span>Once out on the dark landing, the noise of the
storm without told us that we had exaggerated
the necessity for silence; so, grasping the tails
of each other’s nightgowns, even as Alpine
climbers rope themselves together in perilous
places, we fared stoutly down the staircase-moraine,
and across the grim glacier of the
hall, to where a faint glimmer from the half-open
door of the drawing-room beckoned to us
like friendly hostel-lights. Entering, we found
that our thriftless seniors had left the sound red
heart of a fire, easily coaxed into a cheerful
blaze; and biscuits—a plateful—smiled at us
in an encouraging sort of way, together with the
halves of a lemon, already squeezed, but still
suckable. The biscuits were righteously shared,
the lemon segments passed from mouth to
mouth; and as we squatted round the fire, its
genial warmth consoling our unclad limbs, we
realised that so many nocturnal perils had not
been braved in vain.</p>

<p>‘It’s a funny thing,’ said Edward, as we
chatted, ‘how I hate this room in the daytime.
It always means having your face washed, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[216]</a></span>
your hair brushed, and talking silly company
talk. But to-night it’s really quite jolly.
Looks different, somehow.’</p>

<p>‘I never can make out,’ I said, ‘what people
come here to tea for. They can have their
own tea at home if they like—they’re not
poor people—with jam and things, and drink
out of their saucer, and suck their fingers and
enjoy themselves; but they come here from a
long way off, and sit up straight with their feet
off the bars of their chairs, and have one cup,
and talk the same sort of stuff every time.’</p>

<p>Selina sniffed disdainfully. ‘You don’t know
anything about it,’ she said. ‘In society you
have to call on each other. It’s the proper
thing to do.’</p>

<p>‘Pooh! <i>you’re</i> not in society,’ said Edward
politely; ‘and, what’s more, you never will be.’</p>

<p>‘Yes, I shall, some day,’ retorted Selina;
‘but I shan’t ask you to come and see me, so
there!’</p>

<p>‘Wouldn’t come if you did,’ growled Edward.</p>

<p>‘Well you won’t get the chance,’ rejoined
our sister, claiming her right of the last word.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[217]</a></span>
There was no heat about these little amenities,
which made up—as understood by us—the art
of polite conversation.</p>

<p>‘I don’t like society people,’ put in Harold
from the sofa, where he was sprawling at full
length—a sight the daylight hours would have
blushed to witness. ‘There were some of ’em
here this afternoon, when you two had gone off
to the station. O, and I found a dead mouse
on the lawn, and I wanted to skin it, but I
wasn’t sure I knew how, by myself; and they
came out into the garden, and patted my head—I
wish people wouldn’t do that—and one of
’em asked me to pick her a flower. Don’t
know why she couldn’t pick it herself; but I
said, “All right, I will if you’ll hold my mouse.”
But she screamed, and threw it away; and
Augustus (the cat) got it, and ran away with it.
I believe it was really his mouse all the time,
’cos he’d been looking about as if he had lost
something, so I wasn’t angry with <i>him</i>. But
what did <i>she</i> want to throw away my mouse
for?’</p>

<p>‘You have to be careful with mice,’ reflected<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[218]</a></span>
Edward; ‘they’re such slippery things. Do
you remember we were playing with a dead
mouse once on the piano, and the mouse was
Robinson Crusoe, and the piano was the island,
and somehow Crusoe slipped down inside the
island, into its works, and we couldn’t get him
out, though we tried rakes and all sorts of things,
till the tuner came. And that wasn’t till a
week after, and then——’</p>

<p>Here Charlotte, who had been nodding solemnly,
fell over into the fender; and we realised
that the wind had dropped at last, and the house
was lapped in a great stillness. Our vacant
beds seemed to be calling to us imperiously; and
we were all glad when Edward gave the signal
for retreat. At the top of the staircase Harold
unexpectedly turned mutinous, insisting on his
right to slide down the banisters in a free
country. Circumstances did not allow of argument;
I suggested frog’s-marching instead, and
accordingly frog’s-marched he was, the procession
passing solemnly across the moon-lit Blue
Room, with Harold horizontal and limply submissive.
Snug in bed at last, I was just slipping<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[219]</a></span>
off into slumber when I heard Edward explode,
with chuckle and snort.</p>

<p>‘By Jove!’ he said; ‘I forgot all about
it. The new tutor’s sleeping in the Blue
Room!’</p>

<p>‘Lucky he didn’t wake up and catch us,’ I
grunted drowsily; and, without another thought
on the matter, we both sank into well-earned
repose.</p>

<p>Next morning, coming down to breakfast
braced to grapple with fresh adversity, we were
surprised to find our garrulous friend of the
previous day—he was late in making his
appearance—strangely silent and (apparently)
pre-occupied. Having polished off our porridge,
we ran out to feed the rabbits, explaining to
them that a beast of a tutor would prevent
their enjoying so much of our society as
formerly.</p>

<p>On returning to the house at the fated hour
appointed for study, we were thunderstruck to
see the station-cart disappearing down the drive,
freighted with our new acquaintance. Aunt
Eliza was brutally uncommunicative; but she<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[220]</a></span>
was overheard to remark casually that she
thought the man must be a lunatic. In this
theory we were only too ready to concur, dismissing
thereafter the whole matter from our
minds.</p>

<p>Some weeks later it happened that Uncle
Thomas, while paying us a flying visit, produced
from his pocket a copy of the latest weekly,
<i>Psyche: a Journal of the Unseen;</i> and proceeded
laboriously to rid himself of much
incomprehensible humour, apparently at our
expense. We bore it patiently, with the forced
grin demanded by convention, anxious to get
at the source of inspiration, which it presently
appeared lay in a paragraph circumstantially
describing our modest and humdrum habitation.
‘Case <small>III.</small>,’ it began. ‘The following particulars
were communicated by a young member of
the Society, of undoubted probity and earnestness,
and are a chronicle of actual and recent
experience.’ A fairly accurate description of
the house followed, with details that were unmistakable;
but to this there succeeded a flood
of meaningless drivel about apparitions, nightly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[221]</a></span>
visitants, and the like, writ in a manner
betokening a disordered mind, coupled with a
feeble imagination. The fellow was not even
original. All the old material was there—the
storm at night, the haunted chamber, the white
lady, the murder re-enacted, and so on—already
worn threadbare in many a Christmas Number.
No one was able to make head or tail of the
stuff, or of its connexion with our quiet mansion;
and yet Edward, who had always suspected the
fellow, persisted in maintaining that our tutor
of a brief span was, somehow or other, at the
bottom of it.</p>

<h2>A FALLING OUT</h2>


<p class="drop-cap">HAROLD told me the main facts of this
episode some time later,—in bits and
with reluctance. It was not a recollection he
cared to talk about. The crude blank misery
of a moment is apt to leave a dull bruise which
is slow to depart, if it ever do so entirely; and
Harold confesses to a twinge or two, still, at
times, like the veteran who brings home a bullet
inside him from martial plains over sea.</p>

<p>He knew he was a brute the moment he had
done it. Selina had not meant to worry, only
to comfort and assist. But his soul was one
raw sore within him, when he found himself
shut up in the schoolroom after hours, merely
for insisting that 7 times 7 amounted to 47.
The injustice of it seemed so flagrant. Why
not 47 as much as 49! One number was no
prettier than the other to look at, and it was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[226]</a></span>
evidently only a matter of arbitrary taste and
preference, and, anyhow, it had always been
47 to him, and would be to the end of time.
So when Selina came in out of the sun, leaving
the Trappers of the Far West behind her, and
putting off the glory of being an Apache squaw
in order to hear him his tables and win his
release, Harold turned on her venomously, rejected
her kindly overtures, and even drove his
elbow into her sympathetic ribs, in his determination
to be left alone in the glory of sulks.
The fit passed directly, his eyes were opened,
and his soul sat in the dust as he sorrowfully
began to cast about for some atonement heroic
enough to salve the wrong.</p>

<p>Of course poor Selina looked for no sacrifice
nor heroics whatever; she didn’t even want him
to say he was sorry. If he would only make it
up, she would have done the apologising part
herself. But that was not a boy’s way. Something
solid, Harold felt, was due from him; and
until that was achieved, making-up must not
be thought of, in order that the final effect
might not be spoilt. Accordingly, when his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[227]</a></span>
release came, and Selina hung about trying to
catch his eye, Harold, possessed by the demon
of a distorted motive, avoided her steadily—though
he was bleeding inwardly at every
minute of delay—and came to me instead.
Needless to say, I warmly approved his plan.
It was so much more high-toned than just
going and making-up tamely, which any one
could do; and a girl who had been jobbed
in the ribs by a hostile elbow could not be
expected for a moment to overlook it, without
the liniment of an offering to soothe her injured
feelings.</p>

<p>‘I know what she wants most,’ said Harold.
‘She wants that set of tea-things in the toy-shop
window, with the red and blue flowers on ’em;
she’s wanted it for months, ’cos her dolls are
getting big enough to have real afternoon tea;
and she wants it so badly that she won’t walk
that side of the street when we go into the
town. But it costs five shillings!’</p>

<p>Then we set to work seriously, and devoted
the afternoon to a realisation of assets and the
composition of a Budget that might have been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[228]</a></span>
dated without shame from Whitehall. The
result worked out as follows:—</p>



<div class="center">
<table summary="budget" border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">

<tr><td align="right">Total</td><td align="center">5</td><td align="center">0</td></tr>
</tbody></table></div>

<p class="unindent">and at last we breathed again.</p>

<p>The rest promised to be easy. Selina had a
tea-party at five on the morrow, with the chipped
old wooden tea-things that had served her successive
dolls from babyhood. Harold would
slip off directly after dinner, going alone, so as
not to arouse suspicion, as we were not allowed
to go into the town by ourselves. It was nearly
two miles to our small metropolis, but there<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[229]</a></span>
would be plenty of time for him to go and
return, even laden with the olive-branch neatly
packed in shavings. Besides, he might meet the
butcher, who was his friend and would give him
a lift. Then, finally, at five, the rapture of the
new tea-service, descended from the skies; and,
retribution made, making-up at last, without
loss of dignity. With the event before us, we
thought it a small thing that twenty-four hours
more of alienation and pretended sulks must
be kept up on Harold’s part; but Selina, who
naturally knew nothing of the treat in store for
her, moped for the rest of the evening, and took
a very heavy heart to bed.</p>

<p>Next day when the hour for action arrived,
Harold evaded Olympian attention with an
easy modesty born of long practice, and made
off for the front gate. Selina, who had been
keeping her eye upon him, thought he was
going down to the pond to catch frogs, a joy
they had planned to share together, and made
after him. But Harold, though he heard her
footsteps, continued sternly on his high mission,
without even looking back; and Selina was left<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[230]</a></span>
to wander disconsolately among flower-beds that
had lost—for her—all scent and colour. I saw
it all, and, although cold reason approved our
line of action, instinct told me we were brutes.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 500px;">
<img src="The%20Project%20Gutenberg%20eBook%20of%20The%20Golden%20Age,%20by%20Kenneth%20Grahame_files/illus273.jpg" alt="boy looking in shop window" height="695" width="500">
<div class="caption">“SHOPS CAME FIRST, OF COURSE.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.”</div>
</div>

<p>Harold reached the town—so he recounted
afterwards—in record time, having run most
of the way for fear the tea-things, which had
reposed six months in the window, should be
snapped up by some other conscience-stricken
lacerator of a sister’s feelings; and it seemed
hardly credible to find them still there, and
their owner willing to part with them for the
price marked on the ticket. He paid his money
down at once, that there should be no drawing
back from the bargain; and then, as the things
had to be taken out of the window and packed,
and the afternoon was yet young, he thought
he might treat himself to a taste of urban joys
and the <i>vie de Bohême</i>. Shops came first, of
course, and he flattened his nose successively
against the window with the indiarubber balls
in it, and the clock-work locomotive; and
against the barber’s window, with wigs on
blocks, reminding him of uncles, and shaving-cream<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[231]</a></span>
that looked so good to eat; and the
grocer’s window, displaying more currants than
the whole British population could possibly
consume without a special effort; and the
window of the bank, wherein gold was thought
so little of that it was dealt about in shovels.
Next there was the market-place, with all its
clamorous joys; and when a runaway calf came
down the street like a cannon-ball, Harold felt
that he had not lived in vain. The whole place
was so brimful of excitement that he had quite
forgotten the why and the wherefore of his
being there, when a sight of the church clock
recalled him to his better self, and sent him
flying out of the town, as he realised he had
only just time enough left to get back in. If
he were after his appointed hour, he would not
only miss his high triumph, but probably would
be detected as a transgressor of bounds—a
crime before which a private opinion on multiplication
sank to nothingness. So he jogged
along on his homeward way, thinking of many
things, and probably talking to himself a good
deal, as his habit was. He had covered nearly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[232]</a></span>
half the distance, when suddenly—a deadly
sinking in the pit of his stomach—a paralysis
of every limb—around him a world extinct of
light and music—a black sun and a reeling
sky—he had forgotten the tea-things!</p>

<p>It was useless, it was hopeless, all was over
and nothing could now be done. Nevertheless
he turned and ran back wildly, blindly, choking
with the big sobs that evoked neither pity nor
comfort from a merciless mocking world around;
a stitch in his side, dust in his eyes, and black
despair clutching at his heart. So he stumbled
on, with leaden legs and bursting sides, till—as
if Fate had not yet dealt him her last worst
buffet of all—on turning a corner in the road
he almost ran under the wheels of a dog-cart,
in which, as it pulled up, was apparent the
portly form of Farmer Larkin, the arch-enemy,
at whose ducks he had been shying stones that
very morning!</p>

<p>Had Harold been in his right and unclouded
senses, he would have vanished through the
hedge some seconds earlier, rather than pain
the farmer by any unpleasant reminiscences<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[233]</a></span>
which his appearance might recall; but, as
things were, he could only stand and blubber
hopelessly, caring, indeed, little now what
further misery might befall him. The farmer,
for his part, surveyed the desolate figure with
some astonishment, calling out in no unfriendly
accents, ‘Why, Master Harold! whatever be
the matter? Baint runnin’ away, be ee?’</p>

<p>Then Harold, with the unnatural courage
born of desperation, flung himself on the step,
and, climbing into the cart, fell in the straw at
the bottom of it, sobbing out that he wanted to
go back, go back! The situation had a vagueness;
but the farmer, a man of action rather
than of words, swung his horse round smartly,
and they were in the town again by the time
Harold had recovered himself sufficiently to
furnish details. As they drove up to the shop,
the woman was waiting at the door with the
parcel; and hardly a minute seemed to have
elapsed since the black crisis, ere they were
bowling along swiftly home, the precious parcel
hugged in a close embrace.</p>

<p>And now the farmer came out in quite a new<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[234]</a></span>
and unexpected light. Never a word did he
say of broken fences and hurdles, of trampled
crops and harried flocks and herds. One would
have thought the man had never possessed a
head of live stock in his life. Instead, he was
deeply interested in the whole dolorous quest
of the tea-things, and sympathised with Harold
on the disputed point in mathematics as if he
had been himself at the same stage of education.
As they neared home, Harold found
himself, to his surprise, sitting up and chatting
to his new friend like man to man; and before
he was set down at a convenient gap in the
garden hedge, he had promised that when
Selina gave her first public tea-party, little Miss
Larkin should be invited to come and bring
her whole sawdust family along with her; and
the farmer appeared as pleased and proud as if
he had won a gold medal at the Agricultural
Show, and really, when I heard the story, it
began to dawn upon me that those Olympians
must have certain good points, far down in
them, and that I should have to leave off
abusing them some day.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[235]</a></span></p>

<p>At the hour of five, Selina, having spent the
afternoon searching for Harold in all his accustomed
haunts, sat down disconsolately to tea
with her dolls, who ungenerously refused to
wait beyond the appointed hour. The wooden
tea-things seemed more chipped than usual;
and the dolls themselves had more of wax and
sawdust, and less of human colour and intelligence
about them, than she ever remembered
before. It was then that Harold burst in, very
dusty, his stockings at his heels, and the
channels ploughed by tears still showing on his
grimy cheeks; and Selina was at last permitted
to know that he had been thinking of her ever
since his ill-judged exhibition of temper, and
that his sulks had not been the genuine article,
nor had he gone frogging by himself. It was a
very happy hostess who dispensed hospitality
that evening to a glassy-eyed stiff-kneed circle;
and many a dollish <i>gaucherie</i>, that would have
been severely checked on ordinary occasions,
was as much overlooked as if it had been a
birthday.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[236]</a></span></p>

<p>But Harold and I, in what I was afterwards
given to understand was our stupid masculine
way, thought all her happiness sprang from
possession of the long-coveted tea-service.</p>

<h2>‘LUSISTI SATIS’</h2>


<p class="drop-cap">AMONG the many fatuous ideas that possessed
the Olympian noddle, this one was
pre-eminent; that, being Olympians, they could
talk quite freely in our presence on subjects of
the closest import to us, so long as names, dates,
and other landmarks were ignored. We were
supposed to be denied the faculty for putting
two and two together, and like the monkeys,
who very sensibly refrain from speech lest they
should be set to earn their livings, we were
careful to conceal our capabilities for a simple
syllogism. Thus we were rarely taken by surprise,
and so were considered by our disappointed
elders to be apathetic and to lack the divine
capacity for wonder.</p>

<p>Now the daily output of the letter-bag, with
the mysterious discussions that ensued thereon,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[240]</a></span>
had speedily informed us that Uncle Thomas
was intrusted with a mission—a mission, too,
affecting ourselves. Uncle Thomas’s missions
were many and various. A self-important man,
one liking the business while protesting that he
sank under the burden, he was the missionary,
so to speak, of our remote habitation. The
matching a ribbon, the running down to the
stores, the interviewing a cook—these and
similar duties lent constant colour and variety
to his vacant life in London, and helped to keep
down his figure. When the matter, however,
had in our presence to be referred to with nods
and pronouns, with significant hiatuses and
interpolations in the French tongue, then the
red flag was flown, the storm-cone hoisted, and
by a studious pretence of inattention we were
not long in plucking out the heart of the
mystery.</p>

<p>To clinch our conclusion, we descended
suddenly and together on Martha; proceeding,
however, not by simple inquiry as to facts—that
would never have done; but by informing
her that the air was full of school and that we<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[241]</a></span>
knew all about it, and then challenging denial.
Martha was a trusty soul, but a bad witness for
the defence, and we soon had it all out of her.
The word had gone forth, the school had been
selected; the necessary sheets were hemming
even now, and Edward was the designated and
appointed victim.</p>

<p>It had always been before us as an inevitable
bourne, this strange unknown thing called
school; and yet—perhaps I should say consequently—we
had never seriously set ourselves
to consider what it really meant. But now that
the grim spectre loomed imminent, stretching
lean hands for one of our flock, it behoved us
to face the situation, to take soundings in this
uncharted sea and find out whither we were
drifting. Unfortunately the data in our possession
were absolutely insufficient, and we knew
not whither to turn for exact information.
Uncle Thomas could have told us all about
it, of course; he had been there himself, once,
in the dim and misty past. But an unfortunate
conviction, that nature had intended him for
a humorist, tainted all his evidence, besides<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[242]</a></span>
making it wearisome to hear. Again, of such
among our contemporaries as we had approached,
the trumpets gave forth an uncertain
sound. According to some it meant larks,
revels, emancipation, and a foretaste of the
bliss of manhood. According to others—the
majority, alas!—it was a private and peculiar
Hades, that could give the original institution
points and a beating. When Edward was observed
to be swaggering round with a jaunty air
and his chest stuck out, I knew that he was contemplating
his future from the one point of view.
When, on the contrary, he was subdued and
unaggressive, and sought the society of his
sisters, I recognised that the other aspect was
in the ascendant. ‘You can always run away,
you know,’ I used to remark consolingly on
these latter occasions; and Edward would
brighten up wonderfully at the suggestion,
while Charlotte melted into tears before her
vision of a brother with blistered feet and an
empty belly, passing nights of frost ’neath the
lee of windy haystacks.</p>

<p>It was to Edward, of course, that the situation<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[243]</a></span>
was chiefly productive of anxiety; and yet the
ensuing change in my own circumstances and
position furnished me also with food for grave
reflexion. Hitherto I had acted mostly to
orders. Even when I had devised and counselled
any particular devilry, it had been carried
out on Edward’s approbation, and—as eldest—at
his special risk. Henceforward I began to
be anxious of the bugbear Responsibility, and
to realise what a soul-throttling thing it is.
True, my new position would have its compensations.
Edward had been masterful exceedingly,
imperious, perhaps a little narrow;
impassioned for hard facts, and with scant sympathy
for make-believe. I should now be free
and untrammelled; in the conception and the
carrying out of a scheme, I could accept and
reject to better artistic purpose.</p>

<p>It would, moreover, be needless to be a Radical
any more. Radical I never was, really, by
nature or by sympathy. The part had been
thrust on me one day, when Edward proposed
to foist the House of Lords on our small republic.
The principles of the thing he set forth<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[244]</a></span>
learnedly and well, and it all sounded promising
enough, till he went on to explain that, for the
present at least, he proposed to be the House
of Lords himself. We others were to be the
Commons. There would be promotions, of
course, he added, dependent on service and on
fitness, and open to both sexes; and to me in
especial he held out hopes of speedy advancement.
But in its initial stages the thing
wouldn’t work properly unless he were first
and only Lord. Then I put my foot down
promptly, and said it was all rot, and I didn’t
see the good of any House of Lords at all.
‘Then you must be a low Radical!’ said
Edward, with fine contempt. The inference
seemed hardly necessary, but what could I do?
I accepted the situation, and said firmly, Yes, I
was a low Radical. In this monstrous character
I had been obliged to masquerade ever
since; but now I could throw it off, and look
the world in the face again.</p>

<p>And yet, did this and other gains really
outbalance my losses? Henceforth I should,
it was true, be leader and chief; but I should<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[245]</a></span>
also be the buffer between the Olympians and
my little clan. To Edward this had been
nothing; he had withstood the impact of
Olympus without flinching, like Teneriffe or
Atlas unremoved. But was I equal to the
task? And was there not rather a danger that
for the sake of peace and quietness I might be
tempted to compromise, compound, and make
terms? sinking thus, by successive lapses, into
the Blameless Prig? I don’t mean, of course,
that I thought out my thoughts to the exact
point here set down. In those fortunate days
of old one was free from the hard necessity of
transmuting the vague idea into the mechanical
inadequate medium of words. But the feeling
was there, that I might not possess the qualities
of character for so delicate a position.</p>

<p>The unnatural halo round Edward got more
pronounced, his own demeanour more responsible
and dignified, with the arrival of his new
clothes. When his trunk and play-box were
sent in, the approaching cleavage between our
brother, who now belonged to the future, and
ourselves, still claimed by the past, was accentuated<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[246]</a></span>
indeed. His name was painted on each
of them, in large letters, and after their arrival
their owner used to disappear mysteriously, and
be found eventually wandering round his luggage,
murmuring to himself, ‘Edward ——,’ in a rapt
remote sort of way. It was a weakness, of
course, and pointed to a soft spot in his character;
but those who can remember the sensation
of first seeing their names in print will not
think hardly of him.</p>

<p>As the short days sped by and the grim event
cast its shadow longer and longer across our
threshold, an unnatural politeness, a civility
scarce canny, began to pervade the air. In
those latter hours Edward himself was frequently
heard to say ‘Please,’ and also ‘Would
you mind fetchin’ that ball?’ while Harold and
I would sometimes actually find ourselves trying
to anticipate his wishes. As for the girls, they
simply grovelled. The Olympians, too, in their
uncouth way, by gift of carnal delicacies and
such-like indulgence, seemed anxious to demonstrate
that they had hitherto misjudged this one
of us. Altogether the situation grew strained<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[247]</a></span>
and false, and I think a general relief was felt
when the end came.</p>

<p>We all trooped down to the station, of course;
it is only in later years that the farce of ‘seeing
people off’ is seen in its true colours. Edward
was the life and soul of the party; and if his
gaiety struck one at times as being a trifle
overdone, it was not a moment to be critical.
As we tramped along, I promised him I would
ask Farmer Larkin not to kill any more pigs
till he came back for the holidays, and he said
he would send me a proper catapult,—the real
lethal article, not a kid’s plaything. Then
suddenly, when we were about half-way down,
one of the girls fell a-snivelling.</p>

<p>The happy few who dare to laugh at the woes
of sea-sickness will perhaps remember how, on
occasion, the sudden collapse of a fellow-voyager
before their very eyes has caused them hastily to
revise their self-confidence and resolve to walk
more humbly for the future. Even so it was
with Edward, who turned his head aside, feigning
an interest in the landscape. It was but for
a moment; then he recollected the hat he was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[248]</a></span>
wearing—a hard bowler, the first of that sort
he had ever owned. He took it off, examined
it, and felt it over. Something about it seemed
to give him strength, and he was a man once
more.</p>

<p>At the station, Edward’s first care was to
dispose his boxes on the platform so that every
one might see the labels and the lettering
thereon. One did not go to school for the first
time every day! Then he read both sides of
his ticket carefully; shifted it to every one of
his pockets in turn; and finally fell to chinking
of his money, to keep his courage up. We
were all dry of conversation by this time, and
could only stand round and stare in silence
at the victim decked for the altar. And, as I
looked at Edward, in new clothes of a manly
cut, with a hard hat upon his head, a railway
ticket in one pocket and money of his own in
the other—money to spend as he liked and no
questions asked!—I began to feel dimly how
great was the gulf already yawning betwixt us.
Fortunately I was not old enough to realise,
further, that here on this little platform the old<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[249]</a></span>
order lay at its last gasp, and that Edward might
come back to us, but it would not be the Edward
of yore, nor could things ever be the same again.</p>

<p>When the train steamed up at last, we all
boarded it impetuously with the view of selecting
the one peerless carriage to which Edward
might be intrusted with the greatest comfort
and honour; and as each one found the ideal
compartment at the same moment, and vociferously
maintained its merits, he stood some
chance for a time of being left behind. A porter
settled the matter by heaving him through the
nearest door; and as the train moved off,
Edward’s head was thrust out of the window,
wearing on it an unmistakable first-quality grin
that he had been saving up somewhere for the
supreme moment. Very small and white his
face looked, on the long side of the retreating
train. But the grin was visible, undeniable,
stoutly maintained; till a curve swept him from
our sight, and he was borne away in the dying
rumble, out of our placid backwater, out into the
busy world of rubs and knocks and competition,
out into the New Life.</p>

<div class="caption">“.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;SELINA AND CHARLOTTE WERE BUSY STUFFING EDWARD’S<br>
RABBITS WITH UNWONTED FORAGE, BILIOUS AND GREEN”</div>
</div>

<p>When a crab has lost a leg, his gait is still
more awkward than his wont, till Time and
healing Nature make him <i>totus teres atque
rotundus</i> once more. We straggled back from
the station disjointedly; Harold, who was very
silent, sticking close to me, his last slender
prop, while the girls in front, their heads together,
were already reckoning up the weeks to
the holidays. Home at last, Harold suggested
one or two occupations of a spicy and contraband
flavour, but though we did our manful best there
was no knocking any interest out of them. Then
I suggested others, with the same want of success.
Finally we found ourselves sitting silent
on an upturned wheelbarrow, our chins on our
fists, staring haggardly into the raw new conditions
of our changed life, the ruins of a past
behind our backs.</p>

<p>And all the while Selina and Charlotte were
busy stuffing Edward’s rabbits with unwonted
forage, bilious and green; polishing up the cage
of his mice till the occupants raved and swore
like householders in spring-time; and collecting
materials for new bows and arrows, whips, boats,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[251]</a></span>
guns, and four-in-hand harness, against the
return of Ulysses. Little did they dream that
the hero, once back from Troy and all its onsets,
would scornfully condemn their clumsy but
laborious armoury as rot and humbug and
only fit for kids! This, with many another
like awakening, was mercifully hidden from
them. Could the veil have been lifted, and the
girls permitted to see Edward as he would
appear a short three months hence, ragged
of attire and lawless of tongue, a scorner of
tradition and an adept in strange new physical
tortures, one who would in the same half-hour
dismember a doll and shatter a hallowed belief,—in
fine, a sort of swaggering Captain, fresh
from the Spanish Main,—could they have had
the least hint of this, well, then perhaps——.
But which of us is of mental fibre to stand the
test of a glimpse into futurity? Let us only
hope that, even with certain disillusionment
ahead, the girls would have acted precisely
as they did.</p>

<p>And perhaps we have reason to be very grateful
that, both as children and long afterwards,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[252]</a></span>
we are never allowed to guess how the absorbing
pursuit of the moment will appear not only to
others but to ourselves, a very short time hence.
So we pass, with a gusto and a heartiness that
to an onlooker would seem almost pathetic, from
one droll devotion to another misshapen passion;
and who shall dare to play Rhadamanthus, to
appraise the record, and to decide how much
of it is solid achievement, and how much the
merest child’s play?</p>

<h2><i>BOOKS BY KENNETH GRAHAME</i></h2>


<div class="adtitle2">THE GOLDEN AGE</div>

<p class="unindent">16mo. $1.00 net. Twenty-third Edition.</p>


<div class="adtitle2">THE GOLDEN AGE</div>

<p class="unindent">An Illustrated Edition, set in old-faced type, with 18
full-page Photogravures, Title-page, Tail-pieces, and
Cover-design by Maxfield Parrish. Sq. 8vo. $2.50 net.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p class="unindent"><i>New York Times Saturday Review.</i>—‘The new illustrated
edition of “The Golden Age” is published now because the
ordinary half-tone process applied to Maxfield Parrish’s charming
drawings, when the book was first illustrated, did not do
justice to the artist’s work. The original drawings, which
had been sold to many purchasers, were hunted up, and they
have here been reproduced by photogravure. No artist ever
caught the spirit of an author more surely than Maxfield Parrish
has caught that of the staid Secretary of the Old Lady of Threadneedle
Street, who in his leisure hours writes these exquisite
memories of childhood.’</p>

<p class="unindent"><i>Chicago Evening Post.</i>—‘One of the most exquisite pieces of
illustration that has been done in America for some time. A
more felicitous expression of the spirit of Mr. Grahame’s classic
could not be conceived. In this case it is difficult to say, if
indeed it were not invidious to say, which were the more charming,
the more lasting in subtle beauty,—the work of brush or
pen. Together they have made a gem for any library.’</p>

<p class="unindent"><i>New York Evening Post.</i>—‘The publisher, at no little expense
and labor, has sought out the original pictures. The
result is delightful.’</p>

<p class="unindent"><i>Brooklyn Daily Eagle.</i>—‘Decidedly it was a good thought,
this new edition.’</p>

<p class="unindent"><i>Boston Evening Transcript.</i>—‘In point of attractiveness and
beauty this new edition stands by itself.’</p></div>

<div class="adtitle2">DREAM DAYS</div>

<p class="unindent">16mo. $1.00 net. Fourth Edition.</p>


<div class="adtitle2">DREAM DAYS</div>

<p class="unindent">An Illustrated Edition, set in old-faced type, with 10 full-page
Photogravures, Title-page, Tail-pieces, and Cover-design by
Maxfield Parrish. Sq. 8vo. $2.50 net.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p class="unindent"><i>Dial.</i>—‘One of the most delightful holiday books of a season or two
ago was the edition of Mr. Kenneth Grahame’s “The Golden Age,”
with illustrations by Mr. Maxfield Parrish. Even more delightful is
the companion volume now issued containing the same author’s
“Dream Days.” It is hardly necessary to speak of Mr. Grahame’s
text. His two books hold a place apart in the literature of childhood,
and we can well envy the reader who has yet to make their
acquaintance.’</p>

<p class="unindent"><span class="smcap">Dr. Guy Carleton Lee</span>, <i>Baltimore Sun</i>.—‘Very few more delightful
books than “Dream Days” have ever seen the light. If
we were forced to make out a list of the works of literature published
during the last two decades, that are, in our judgment,
likely to be alive two decades hence, in the very brief list we
should certainly include “Dream Days.”’</p>

<p class="unindent"><i>Churchman.</i>—‘To put yourself in a child’s place, to think a boy’s
thoughts about the happenings of everyday life, is a rare quality in
any writer. Still more rare is it, perhaps, to dream the child’s dreams
in literary form, to preserve the evanescent glow of juvenile fancy.
In that art, as it seems to us, Kenneth Grahame has no present rival.’</p>

<p class="unindent"><i>Boston Evening Transcript.</i>—‘Hardly since Robert Louis Stevenson’s
“A Child’s Garden of Verses” have we had such imaginative presentation
of the juvenile point of view.’</p>

<p class="unindent"><i>Brooklyn Eagle.</i>—‘Mr. Grahame is one of those wizards whose magic
has created pictures of childlife exquisite in humour, quaint in fancy,
subtle in charm. In Mr. Maxfield Parrish the author has an ideal
illustrator.’</p>

<p class="unindent"><i>New York Tribune.</i>—‘Mr. Parrish is one of the most original and
effective draughtsmen that we have, and in this series of illustrations
he is at his best. A more exquisitely decorated Christmas
book than this it has not been our fortune to see.’</p></div>

<p class="unindent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[255]</a></span></p>


<div class="adtitle2">PAGAN PAPERS</div>

<p class="unindent">16mo. $1.00 net. Second Edition.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p class="unindent"><i>Academy.</i>—‘Rarely does one meet with an author whose wit is so apt,
whose touches of sentiment are so genuine. His paper on tobacco is
good reading, though one remembers Calverley and the Arcadian
mixture; the eulogy on the loafer is second only to Mr. Stevenson’s
praise of “The Idler.” There is too a distinct flavour of poetry in
much of Mr. Grahame’s works. One could have wished “White
Poppies” had been written in verse, were not the prose of it so delicate
and adequate.’</p>

<p class="unindent"><i>Daily Chronicle.</i>—‘Mr. Kenneth Grahame’s accomplishment is astounding.&nbsp;...
His style is a delight, so high is its vitality, or cool
its colours, so nimble and various its rhythms. He has read and
assimilated Browne Burton. He has a pretty poetic fancy and is apt
at a quaint analogy. Many forms of beauty—existent and non-existent—he
loves with a deep and discriminating love.’</p></div>


<div class="adtitle2">THE HEADSWOMAN</div>

<p class="unindent">16mo. 50 cents net. New Edition.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p class="unindent"><i>Bookman.</i>—‘Mr. Grahame’s cleverness does not forsake him when he
attempts satire. “The Headswoman” is a pretty bit of foolery.’</p>

<p class="unindent"><i>Literary World.</i>—‘A delightful little tale with a tinge of satire in it.
For gracefulness of style and charm in the telling of a story it is in
the front rank, and that is saying a great deal.’</p>

<p class="unindent"><i>Dundee Advertiser.</i>—‘Humour is not dead amongst us, for Kenneth
Grahame’s witty little romance of “The Headswoman” brims over
with it.’</p>

<p class="unindent"><span class="smcap">Mr. W. L. Courtney</span> in <i>Daily Telegraph</i>.—‘Well we are more
than a trifle dull, <i>nous autres;</i> and we should be grateful to Mr.
Kenneth Grahame for throwing in a story or two of his own, as often
as he can. Happy Mr. Grahame, who can weave romances as well.’</p>

<p class="unindent"><i>Scotsman.</i>—‘Mr. Grahame has written a most charming book, which
cannot fail to delight all who were once children.’</p></div>

<h3>Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation</h3>

<p>Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.</p>

<p>The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit <a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/donate">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.</p>

<p>While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.</p>

<p>International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.</p>

<p>Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate</p>

<h3>Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.</h3>

<p>Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.</p>

<p>Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.</p>

<p>Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org</p>

<p>This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.</p>
