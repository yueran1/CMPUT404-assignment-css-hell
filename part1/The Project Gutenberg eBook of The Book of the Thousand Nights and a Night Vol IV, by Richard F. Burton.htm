  <h2 class="c007"><em>NI’AMAH BIN AL-RABI’A AND NAOMI HIS SLAVE-GIRL.</em></h2>
</div>

<p class="c013">There lived once in the city of Cufa<a id="r1"></a><a href="#f1" class="c014"><sup>[1]</sup></a> a man called Al-Rabí’a
bin Hátim, who was one of the chief men of the town, a wealthy
and a healthy, and Heaven had vouchsafed him a son, whom he
named Ni’amat Allah.<a id="r2"></a><a href="#f2" class="c014"><sup>[2]</sup></a> One day, being in the slave-brokers’
mart, he saw a woman exposed for sale with a little maid of
wonderful beauty and grace on her arm. So he beckoned to
the broker and asked him, “How much for this woman and her
daughter?” He answered “Fifty dinars.” Quoth Al-Rabi’a “Write
the contract of sale and take the money and give it to her owner.”
Then he gave the broker the price and his brokerage and taking
the woman and her child, carried them to his house. Now when
the daughter of his uncle who was his wife saw the slave, she said
to her husband, “O my cousin, what is this damsel?” He replied,
“Of a truth, I bought her for the sake of the little one on her
arm; for know that, when she groweth up, there will not be her
like for beauty, either in the land of the Arabs or the Ajams.”
His wife remarked, “Right was thy rede”; and said to the woman,
“What is thy name?” She replied, “O my lady, my name is
Taufík.<a id="r3"></a><a href="#f3" class="c014"><sup>[3]</sup></a>” “And what is thy daughter’s name?” asked she.
Answered the slave, “Sa’ad, the happy.” Rejoined her mistress,
“Thou sayst sooth, thou art indeed happy, and happy is he who
hath bought thee.” Then quoth she to her husband, “O my
cousin, what wilt thou call her?”; and quoth he, “Whatso thou
<span class="pageno" id="Page_2">2</span>choosest”; so she, “Then let us call her Naomi;” and he rejoined,
“Good is thy device.” The little Naomi was reared with Al-Rabi’a’s
son Ni’amat in one cradle, so to speak, till the twain
reached the age of ten and each grew handsomer than the other;
and the boy used to address her, “O my sister!” and she, “O
my brother!”, till they came to that age when Al-Rabi’a said to
Ni’amah, “O my son, Naomi is not thy sister but thy slave. I
bought her in thy name whilst thou wast yet in the cradle; so
call her no more sister from this day forth.” Quoth Ni’amah,
“If that be so, I will take her to wife.” Then he went to his
mother and told her of this, and she said to him, “O my son,
she is thy handmaid.” So he wedded and went in unto Naomi
and loved her; and two<a id="r4"></a><a href="#f4" class="c014"><sup>[4]</sup></a> years passed over them whilst in this
condition, nor was there in all Cufa a fairer girl than Naomi, or
a sweeter or a more graceful. As she grew up she learnt the
Koran and read works of science and excelled in music and
playing upon all kinds of instruments; and in the beauty of her
singing she surpassed all the folk of her time. Now one day,
as she sat with her husband in the wine-chamber, she took the
lute, tightened the strings, and sang these two couplets:—</p>

<div class="lg-container-b c003">
  <div class="linegroup">
    <div class="group">
      <div class="line">While thou’rt my lord whose bounty’s my estate, ✿ A sword whereby my woes to annihilate,</div>
      <div class="line">Recourse I never need to Amru or Zayd,<a id="r5"></a><a href="#f5" class="c014"><sup>[5]</sup></a> ✿ Nor aught save thee if way to me grow strait!</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class="c000">Ni’amah was charmed with these verses and said to her, “By my
life, O Naomi, sing to us with the tambourine and other instruments!”
So she sang these couplets to a lively measure:—</p>

<div class="lg-container-b c003">
  <div class="linegroup">
    <div class="group">
      <div class="line">By His life who holds my guiding-rein, I swear ✿ I’ll meet on love-ground parlous foe nor care:</div>
      <div class="line">Good sooth I’ll vex revilers, thee obey ✿ And quit my slumbers and all joy forswear:</div>
      <div class="line">And for thy love I’ll dig in vitals mine ✿ A grave, nor shall my vitals weet ‘tis there!</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class="c000"><span class="pageno" id="Page_3">3</span>And Ni’amah exclaimed, “Heaven favoured art thou, O Naomi!”
But whilst they led thus the most joyous life, behold! Al-Hajjáj,<a id="r6"></a><a href="#f6" class="c014"><sup>[6]</sup></a>
the Viceroy of Cufa said to himself, “Needs must I contrive to
take this girl named Naomi and send her to the Commander of
the Faithful, Abd al-Malik bin Marwán, for he hath not in his
palace her like for beauty and sweet singing.” So he summoned
an old woman of the duennas of his wives and said to her, “Go
to the house of Al-Rabi’a and foregather with the girl Naomi
and combine means to carry her off; for her like is not to be
found on the face of the earth.” She promised to do his bidding;
so next morning she donned the woollen clothes of a devotee
and hung around her neck a rosary of beads by the thousand;
and, hending in hand a staff and a leather water-bottle of Yamani
manufacture,——And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and
ceased to say her permitted say.</p>

<div>

<div class="nf-center-c1">
<div class="nf-center c005">
    <div>Now when it was the Two Hundred and Thirty-eighth Night,</div>
  </div>
</div>

</div>

<p class="c000">She said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that the old
woman promised to do the bidding of Al-Hajjaj, and whenas it
<span class="pageno" id="Page_4">4</span>was morning she donned the woollen clothes of a devotee<a id="r7"></a><a href="#f7" class="c014"><sup>[7]</sup></a> and
hung around her neck a rosary of beads by the thousand and
hent in hand a staff and a leather water-bottle of Yamani manufacture
and fared forth crying, “Glory be to Allah! Praised be
Allah! There is no god but <em>the</em> God! Allah is Most Great!
There is no Majesty and there is no Might save in Allah, the
Glorious, the Great!” Nor did she leave off her lauds and her
groaning in prayer whilst her heart was full of guile and wiles,
till she came to the house of Ni’amah bin al-Rabi’a at the hour of
noon-prayer, and knocked at the door. The doorkeeper opened
and said to her, “What dost thou want?” Quoth she, “I am a
poor pious woman, whom the time of noon-prayer hath overtaken,
and lief would I pray in this blessed place.” Answered the
porter, “O old woman, this is no mosque nor oratory, but the
house of Ni’amah son of al-Rabi’a.” She replied, “I know
there is neither cathedral-mosque nor oratory like the house of
Ni’amah bin al-Rabi’a. I am a chamberwoman of the palace of
the Prince of True Believers and am come out for worship and
the visitation of Holy Places.” But the porter rejoined, “Thou
canst not enter;” and many words passed between them, till at
last she caught hold and hung to him saying, “Shall the like of
me be denied admission to the house of Ni’amah bin al-Rabi’a,
I who have free access to the houses of Emirs and Grandees?”
Anon, out came Ni’amah and, hearing their loud language,
laughed and bade the old woman enter after him. So she
followed him into the presence of Naomi, whom she saluted
after the godliest and goodliest fashion, and, when she looked
on her, she was confounded at her exceeding seemlihead and
said to her, “O my lady, I commend thee to the safeguard of
Allah, who made thee and thy lord fellows in beauty and loveliness!”
Then she stood up in the prayer-niche and betook herself
to inclination and prostration and prayer, till day departed
and night darkened and starkened, when Naomi said to her,
“O my mother, rest thy legs and feet awhile.” Replied the old
<span class="pageno" id="Page_5">5</span>woman, “O my lady, whoso seeketh the world to come let him
weary him in this world, and whoso wearieth not himself in this
world shall not attain the dwellings of the just in the world to
come.” Then Naomi brought her food and said to her, “Eat
of my bread and pray Heaven to accept my penitence and to
have mercy on me.” But she cried, “O my lady, I am fasting.
As for thee, thou art but a girl and it besitteth thee to eat and
drink and make merry; Allah be indulgent to thee!; for the
Almighty saith:—All shall be punished except him who shall
repent and believe and shall work a righteous work.”<a id="r8"></a><a href="#f8" class="c014"><sup>[8]</sup></a> So
Naomi continued sitting with the old woman in talk and presently
said to Ni’amah, “O my lord, conjure this ancient dame
to sojourn with us awhile, for piety and devotion are imprinted
on her countenance.” Quoth he, “Set apart for her a chamber
where she may say her prayers; and suffer no one to go in
to her: peradventure, Allah (extolled and exalted be He!)
shall prosper us by the blessing of her presence and never
separate us.” So the old woman passed her night in praying
and reciting the Koran; and when Allah caused the morn to
dawn, she went in to Ni’amah and Naomi and, giving them good
morning, said to them, “I pray Allah have you in His holy
keeping!” Quoth Naomi, “Whither away, O my mother? My
lord hath bidden me set apart for thee a chamber, where thou
mayst seclude thee for thy devotions.” Replied the old woman,
“Allah give him long life, and continue His favour to you both!
But I would have you charge the doorkeeper not to stay my
coming in to you; and, Inshallah! I will go the round of the
Holy Places and pray for you two at the end of my devotions
every day and night.” Then she went out (whilst Naomi wept
for parting with her knowing not the cause of her coming), and
returned to Al-Hajjaj who said to her, “An thou do my bidding
soon, thou shalt have of me abundant good.” Quoth she, “I ask
of thee a full month;” and quoth he “Take the month.” Thereupon
the old hag fell to daily visiting Ni’amah’s house and frequented
his slave-wife, Naomi;——And Shahrazad perceived the
dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say.</p>

<div><span class="pageno" id="Page_6">6</span></div>
<div>

<div class="nf-center-c1">
<div class="nf-center c005">
    <div>Now when it was the Two Hundred and Thirty-ninth Night,</div>
  </div>
</div>

</div>

<p class="c000">She said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that the old hag
fell to visiting daily Ni’amah’s house and frequenting his slave-wife,
Naomi; and both ceased not to honour her, and she used to
go in to them morning and evening and all in the house respected
her till, one day, being alone with Naomi, she said to her, “O my
lady! by Allah, when I go to the Holy Places, I will pray for
thee; and I only wish thou wert with me, that thou mightest look
on the Elders of the Faith who resort thither, and they should
pray for thee, according to thy desire.” Naomi cried, “I conjure
thee by Allah take me with thee!”; and she replied, “Ask leave
of thy mother-in-law, and I will take thee.” So Naomi said to
her husband’s mother, “O my lady, ask my master to let us go
forth, me and thee, one day with this my old mother, to prayer
and worship with the Fakirs in the Holy Places.” Now when
Ni’amah came in and sat down, the old woman went up to him
and would have kissed his hand, but he forbade her; so she
invoked blessings<a id="r9"></a><a href="#f9" class="c014"><sup>[9]</sup></a> on him and left the house. Next day she
came again, in the absence of Ni’amah, and she addressed Naomi,
saying, “We prayed for thee yesterday; but arise now and divert
thyself and return ere thy lord come home.” So Naomi said to
her mother-in-law, “I beseech thee, for Allah’s sake, give me
leave to go with this pious woman, that I may sight the saints
of Allah in the Holy Places, and return speedily ere my lord come
back.” Quoth Ni’amah’s mother, “I fear lest thy lord know;”
but said the old woman, “By Allah, I will not let her take seat
on the floor; no, she shall look, standing on her feet, and not
tarry.” So she took the damsel by guile and, carrying her to Al-Hajjaj’s
palace, told him of her coming, after placing her in a
lonely chamber; whereupon he went in to her and, looking upon
her, saw her to be the loveliest of the people of the day, never
had he beheld her like. Now when Naomi caught sight of him
she veiled her face from him; but he left her not till he had called
<span class="pageno" id="Page_7">7</span>his Chamberlain, whom he commanded to take fifty horsemen;
and he bade him mount the damsel on a swift dromedary, and
bear her to Damascus and there deliver her to the Commander of
the Faithful, Abd al-Malik bin Marwan. Moreover, he gave him
a letter for the Caliph, saying, “Bear him this letter and bring me
his answer and hasten thy return to me.” So the Chamberlain,
without losing time, took the damsel (and she tearful for separation
from her lord) and, setting out with her on a dromedary, gave
not over journeying till he reached Damascus. There he sought
audience of the Commander of the Faithful and, when it was
granted, the Chamberlain delivered the damsel and reported the
circumstance. The Caliph appointed her a separate apartment
and going into his Harim, said to his wife, “Al-Hajjaj hath bought
me a slave-girl of the daughters of the Kings of Cufa<a id="r10"></a><a href="#f10" class="c014"><sup>[10]</sup></a> for ten
thousand dinars, and hath sent me this letter.”——And Shahrazad
perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say.</p>

<div>

<div class="nf-center-c1">
<div class="nf-center c005">
    <div>Now when it was the Two Hundred and Fortieth Night,</div>
  </div>
</div>

</div>

<p class="c000">She said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that when the
Caliph acquainted his wife with the story of the slave-girl, she said
to him, “Allah increase to thee His favour!” Then the Caliph’s
sister went in to the supposed slave-girl and, when she saw her,
she said, “By Allah, not unlucky is the man who hath thee in his
house, were thy cost an hundred thousand dinars!” And Naomi
replied, “O fair of face, what King’s palace is this, and what is the
city?” She answered, “This is the city of Damascus, and this is
the palace of my brother, the Commander of the Faithful, Abd al-Malik
bin Marwan.<a id="r11"></a><a href="#f11" class="c014"><sup>[11]</sup></a>” Then she resumed, “Didst thou not know all
this?” Naomi said, “By Allah, O my lady, I had no knowledge
of it!”; when the other asked, “And he who sold thee and took
thy price did he not tell thee that the Caliph had bought thee?”
<span class="pageno" id="Page_8">8</span>Now when Naomi heard these words, she shed tears and said to
herself, “Verily, I have been tricked and the trick hath succeeded,”
adding to herself, “If I speak, none will credit me; so I will hold
my peace and take patience, for I know that the relief of Allah is
near.” Then she bent her head for shame, and indeed her cheeks
were tanned by the journey and the sun. So the Caliph’s sister
left her that day and returned to her on the morrow with clothes and
necklaces of jewels, and dressed her; after which the Caliph came
in to her and sat down by her side, and his sister said to him,
“Look on this handmaid in whom Allah hath conjoined every
perfection of beauty and loveliness.” So he said to Naomi, “Draw
back the veil from thy face;” but she would not unveil, and he
beheld not her face. However, he saw her wrists and love of her
entered his heart; and he said to his sister, “I will not go in unto
her for three days, till she be cheered by thy converse.” Then he
arose and left her, but Naomi ceased not to brood over her case
and sigh for her separation from her master, Ni’amah, till she fell
sick of a fever during the night and ate not nor drank; and her
favour faded and her charms were changed. They told the Caliph
of this and her condition grieved him; so he visited her with
physicians and men of skill, but none could come at a cure for
her. This how it fared with her; but as regards Ni’amah, when
he returned home he sat down on his bed and cried, “Ho,
Naomi!” But she answered not; so he rose in haste and called
out, yet none came to him, as all the women in the house had
hidden themselves for fear of him. Then he went out to his
mother, whom he found sitting with her cheek on her hand, and
said to her, “O my mother, where is Naomi?” She answered,
“O my son, she is with one who is worthier than I to be trusted
with her, namely, the devout old woman; she went forth with her
to visit devotionally the Fakirs and return.” Quoth Ni’amah,
“Since when hath this been her habit and at what hour went she
forth?” Quoth his mother, “She went out early in the morning.”
He asked, “And how camest thou to give her leave for this?”;
and she answered, “O my son, ‘twas she persuaded me?” “There
is no Majesty and there is no Might save in Allah, the Glorious,
the Great!” exclaimed Ni’amah and, going forth from his home
in a state of distraction, he repaired to the Captain of the Watch
to whom said he, “Dost thou play tricks upon me and steal my
slave-girl away from my house? I will assuredly complain of
thee to the Commander of the Faithful.” Said the Chief of
<span class="pageno" id="Page_9">9</span>Police, “Who hath taken her?” and Ni’amah replied, “An old
woman of such and such a mien, clad in woollen raiment and
carrying a rosary of beads numbered by thousands.” Rejoined
the other, “Find me the old woman and I will get thee back
thy slave-girl.” “And who knows the old woman?” retorted
Ni’amah. “And who knows the hidden things save Allah (may
He be extolled and exalted!)?” cried the Chief, who knew her
for Al-Hajjaj’s procuress. Cried Ni’amah, “I look to thee for
my slave-girl, and Al-Hajjaj shall judge between thee and me;”
and the Master of Police answered, “Go to whom thou wilt.”
So Ni’amah went to the palace of Al-Hajjaj, for his father was
one of the chief men of Cufa; and, when he arrived there, the
Chamberlain went in to the Governor and told him the case;
whereupon Al-Hajjaj said, “Hither with him!” and when he
stood before him enquired, “What be thy business?” Said
Ni’amah, “Such and such things have befallen me;” and the
Governor said, “Bring me the Chief of Police, and we will command
him to seek for the old woman.” Now he knew that the
Chief of Police was acquainted with her; so, when he came, he
said to him, “I wish thee to make search for the slave-girl of
Ni’amah son of Al-Rabi’a.” And he answered, “None knoweth
the hidden things save Almighty Allah.” Rejoined Al-Hajjaj,
“There is no help for it but thou send out horsemen and look
for the damsel in all the roads, and seek for her in the towns.”——And
Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say
her permitted say.</p>

<div>

<div class="nf-center-c1">
<div class="nf-center c005">
    <div>Now when it was the Two Hundred and Forty-first Night,</div>
  </div>
</div>

</div>

<p class="c000">She said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that Al-Hajjaj
said to the Captain of the watch, “There is no help for
it but thou send out horsemen, and look for the damsel on all the
roads and seek for her in the towns.” Then he turned to Ni’amah
and said to him, “An thy slave-girl return not, I will give thee ten
slave-girls from my house and ten from that of the Chief of
Police.” And he again bade the Captain of the Watch, “Go and
seek for the girl.” So he went out, and Ni’amah returned home
full of trouble and despairing of life; for he had now reached the
age of fourteen and there was yet no hair on his side-cheeks. So
he wept and lamented and shut himself up from his household;
and ceased not to weep and lament, he and his mother, till the
<span class="pageno" id="Page_10">10</span>morning, when his father came in to him and said, “O my son, of
a truth, Al-Hajjaj hath put a cheat upon the damsel and hath
taken her; but from hour to hour Allah giveth relief.” However
grief redoubled on Ni’amah, so that he knew not what he said nor
knew he who came in to him, and he fell sick for three months;
his charms were changed, his father despaired of him and the
physicians visited him and said, “There is no remedy for him save
the damsel.” Now as his father was sitting one day, behold,
he heard tell of a skilful Persian physician, whom the folk gave
out for perfect in medicine and astrology and geomancy. So
Al-Rabi’a sent for him and, seating him by his side, entreated
him with honour and said to him, “Look into my son’s case.”
Thereupon quoth he to Ni’amah, “Give me thy hand.” The young
man gave him his hand and he felt his pulse and his joints and
looked in his face; then he laughed and, turning to his father,
said, “Thy son’s sole ailment is one of the heart.”<a id="r12"></a><a href="#f12" class="c014"><sup>[12]</sup></a> He replied,
“Thou sayest sooth, O sage, but apply thy skill to his state and
case, and acquaint me with the whole thereof and hide naught
from me of his condition.” Quoth the Persian, “Of a truth he is
enamoured of a slave-girl and this slave-girl is either in Bassorah
or Damascus; and there is no remedy for him but reunion with
her.” Said Al-Rabi’a, “An thou bring them together, thou shalt
live all thy life in wealth and delight.” Answered the Persian,
“In good sooth this be an easy matter and soon brought about;”
and he turned to Ni’amah and said to him, “No hurt shall befal
thee; so be of good cheer and keep thine eyes cool and clear.”
Then quoth he to Al-Rabi’a, “Bring me out four thousand dinars
of your money;” so he gave them to him, and he added, “I wish
to carry thy son with me to Damascus; and Almighty Allah
willing, I will not return thence but with the damsel.” Then he
turned to the youth and asked, “What is thy name?”; and he
answered “Ni’amah.” Quoth the Persian, “O Ni’amah, sit up and
be of good heart, for Allah will reunite thee with the damsel.”
And when he sat up the leach continued, “Be of good cheer for
we set out for Damascus this very day: put thy trust in the Lord,
and eat and drink and be cheerful so as to fortify thyself for
travel.” Upon this the Persian began making preparation of all
things needed, such as presents and rarities; and he took of
<span class="pageno" id="Page_11">11</span>Al-Rabi’a in all the sum of ten thousand dinars, together with
horses and camels and beasts of burden and other requisites.
Then Ni’amah farewelled his father and mother and journeyed
with the physician to Aleppo. They could find no news of Naomi
there, so they fared on to Damascus, where they abode three days,
after which the Persian took a shop and he adorned even the
shelves with vessels of costly porcelain, with covers of silver, and
with gildings and stuffs of price. Moreover, he set before himself
vases and flagons of glass full of all manner of ointments and
syrups, and he surrounded them with cups of crystal and, placing
astrolabe and geomantic tablet facing him, he donned a physician’s
habit and took his seat in the shop. Then he set Ni’amah standing
before him clad in a shirt and gown of silk and, girding his
middle with a silken kerchief gold-embroidered, said to him, “O
Ni’amah, henceforth thou art my son; so call me naught but
sire, and I will call thee naught but son.” And he replied, “I
hear and I obey.” Thereupon the people of Damascus flocked to
the Persian’s shop that they might gaze on the youth’s goodliness
and the beauty of the shop and its contents, whilst the physician
spoke to Ni’amah in Persian and he answered him in the same
tongue, for he knew the language, after the wont of the sons of the
notables. So that Persian doctor soon became known among the
townsfolk and they began to acquaint him with their ailments,
and he to prescribe for them remedies. Moreover, they brought
him the water of the sick in phials,<a id="r13"></a><a href="#f13" class="c014"><sup>[13]</sup></a> and he would test it and say,
“He, whose water this is, is suffering from such and such a
disease,” and the patient would declare, “Verily this physician
sayeth sooth.” So he continued to do the occasions of the folk
and they to flock to him, till his fame spread throughout the
city and into the houses of the great. Now, one day as he sat in
his shop, behold, there came up an old woman riding on an ass
with a stuffed saddle of brocade embroidered with jewels; and,
stopping before the Persian’s shop, drew rein and beckoned him,
saying, “Take my hand.” He took her hand, and she alighted
and asked him, “Art thou the Persian physician from Irak?”
“Yes,” answered he, and she said, “Know that I have a sick
daughter.” Then she brought out to him a phial and the Persian
looked at it and said to her, “O my mistress, tell me thy
<span class="pageno" id="Page_12">12</span>daughter’s name, that I may calculate her horoscope and learn
the hour in which it will befit her to drink medicine.” She
replied, “O my brother the Persian,<a id="r14"></a><a href="#f14" class="c014"><sup>[14]</sup></a> her name is Naomi.”——And
Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her
permitted say.</p>

<div>

<div class="nf-center-c1">
<div class="nf-center c005">
    <div>Now when it was the Two Hundred and Forty-second Night,</div>
  </div>
</div>

</div>

<p class="c000">She said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that when the
Persian heard the name of Naomi, he fell to calculating and
writing on his hand and presently said, “O my lady, I cannot
prescribe a medicine for her till I know what country woman she
is, because of the difference of climate: so tell me in what land
she was brought up and what is her age.” The old woman replied,
“She is fourteen years old and she was brought up in Cufa of
Irak.” He asked, “And how long hath she sojourned in this
country?” “But a few months,” answered she. Now when
Ni’amah heard the old woman’s words and recognised the name
of his slave-girl, his heart fluttered and he was like to faint. Then
said the Persian, “Such and such medicines will suit her case;”
and the old woman rejoined, “Then make them up and give me
what thou hast mentioned, with the blessing of Almighty Allah.”
So saying, she threw upon the shop-board ten gold pieces; and he
looked at Ni’amah and bade him prepare the necessary drugs;
whereupon she also looked at the youth and exclaimed, “Allah
have thee in his keeping, O my son! Verily, she favoureth thee
in age and mien.” Then said she to the physician, “O my brother
the Persian, is this thy slave or thy son?” “He is my son,”
answered he. So Ni’amah put up the medicine and, placing it in
a little box, took a piece of paper and wrote thereon these two
couplets:<a id="r15"></a><a href="#f15" class="c014"><sup>[15]</sup></a>—</p>

<div class="lg-container-b c003">
  <div class="linegroup">
    <div class="group">
      <div class="line">If Naomi bless me with a single glance, ✿ Let Su’adá sue and Juml joy to pet:</div>
      <div class="line">They said, “Forget her: twenty such thou’lt find.” ✿ But none is like her—I will <em>not</em> forget!</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class="c000"><span class="pageno" id="Page_13">13</span>He pressed the paper into the box and, sealing it up, wrote upon
the cover the following words in Cufic character, “I am Ni’amah
son of al-Rabi’a of Cufa.” Then he set it before the old woman
who took it and bade them farewell and returned to the Caliph’s
palace; and when she went up with the drugs to the damsel she
placed the little box of medicine at her feet, saying, “O my lady,
know that there is lately come to our town a Persian physician,
than whom I never saw a more skilful nor a better versed in
matters of malady. I told him thy name, after showing him the
water-bottle, and forthwith he knew thine ailment and prescribed
a remedy. Then he bade his son make thee up this medicine;
and there is not in Damascus a comelier or a seemlier youth than
this lad of his, nor hath anyone a shop the like of his shop.” So
Naomi took the box and, seeing the names of her lord and his
father written on the cover, changed colour and said to herself,
“Doubtless, the owner of this shop is come in search of me.” So
she said to the old woman, “Describe to me this youth.” Answered
the old woman, “His name is Ni’amah, he hath a mole on his
right eyebrow, is richly clad and is perfectly handsome.” Cried
Naomi, “Give me the medicine, whereon be the blessing and help
of Almighty Allah!” So she drank off the potion (and she
laughing) and said, “Indeed, it is a blessed medicine!” Then she
sought in the box and, finding the paper, opened it, read it, understood
it and knew that this was indeed her lord, whereat her heart
was solaced and she rejoiced. Now when the old woman saw
her laughing, she exclaimed, “This is indeed a blessed day!”; and
Naomi said, “O nurse, I have a mind for something to eat and
drink.” The old woman said to the serving-women, “Bring a tray
of dainty viands for your mistress”; whereupon they set food before
her and she sat down to eat. And behold in came the Caliph who,
seeing her sitting at meat, rejoiced; and the old woman said to
him, “O Commander of the Faithful, I give thee joy of thy handmaid
Naomi’s recovery! And the cause is that there is lately come
to this our city a physician than whom I never saw a better versed
in diseases and their remedies. I fetched her medicine from him
and she hath drunken of it but once and is restored to health.”
Quoth he, “Take a thousand dinars and apply thyself to her
treatment, till she be completely recovered.” And he went away,
rejoicing in the damsel’s recovery, whilst the old woman betook
herself to the Persian’s house and delivered the thousand dinars,
giving him to know that she was become the Caliph’s slave and also
<span class="pageno" id="Page_14">14</span>handing him a letter which Naomi had written. He took it and gave
the letter to Ni’amah, who at first sight knew her hand and fell
down in a swoon. When he revived he opened the letter and
found these words written therein: “From the slave despoiled of
her Ni’amah, her delight; her whose reason hath been beguiled
and who is parted from the core of her heart. But afterwards.
Of a truth thy letter hath reached me and hath broadened my
breast, and solaced my soul, even as saith the poet:—</p>

<div class="lg-container-b c003">
  <div class="linegroup">
    <div class="group">
      <div class="line">Thy note came: long lost fingers wrote that note, ✿ Till drop they sweetest scents for what they wrote:</div>

    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class="c000">When Ni’amah read these verses, his eyes ran over with tears and
the old woman said to him, “What maketh thee to weep, O my
son? Allah never cause thine eye to shed tears!” Cried the
Persian, “O my lady, how should my son not weep, seeing that
this is his slave-girl and he her lord, Ni’amah son of al-Rabi’a of
Cufa; and her health dependeth on her seeing him, for naught
aileth her but loving him.”——And Shahrazad perceived the dawn
of day and ceased to say her permitted say.</p>

<div>

<div class="nf-center-c1">
<div class="nf-center c005">
    <div>Now when it was the Two Hundred and Forty-third Night,</div>
  </div>
</div>

</div>

<p class="c000">She said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that the Persian
cried out to the old woman, “How shall my son not weep, seeing
that this is his slave-girl and he her lord, Ni’amah son of al-Rabi’a
of Cufa; and the health of this damsel dependeth on her seeing
him and naught aileth her but loving him. So, do thou, O my
lady, take these thousand dinars to thyself and thou shalt have of
<span class="pageno" id="Page_15">15</span>me yet more than this; only look on us with eyes of ruth; for
we know not how to bring this affair to a happy end save through
thee.” Then she said to Ni’amah, “Say, art thou indeed her
lord?” He replied, “Yes,” and she rejoined, “Thou sayest
sooth; for she ceaseth not continually to name thee.” Then he
told her all that had passed from first to last, and she said, “O
youth, thou shalt owe thy reunion with her to none but myself.”
So she mounted and, at once returning to Naomi, looked in her
face and laughed saying, “It is just, O my daughter, that thou
weep and fall sick for thy separation from thy master, Ni’amah
son of Al-Rabi’a of Cufa.” Quoth Naomi, “Verily, the veil hath
been withdrawn for thee and the truth revealed to thee.” Rejoined
the old woman, “Be of good cheer and take heart, for I will
assuredly bring you together, though it cost me my life.” Then
she returned to Ni’amah and said to him, “I went to thy slave-girl
and conversed with her, and I find that she longeth for thee
yet more than thou for her; for although the Commander of the
Faithful is minded to become intimate with her, she refuseth
herself to him. But if thou be stout of purpose and firm of
heart, I will bring you together and venture my life for you, and
play some trick and make shift to carry thee into the Caliph’s
palace, where thou shalt meet her, for she cannot come forth.”
And Ni’amah answered, “Allah requite thee with good!” Then
she took leave of him and went back to Naomi and said, “Thy
lord is indeed dying of love for thee and would fain see thee and
foregather with thee. What sayest thou?” Naomi replied, “And
I too am longing for his sight and dying for his love.” Whereupon
the old woman took a parcel of women’s clothes and ornaments
and, repairing to Ni’amah, said to him, “Come with me into some
place apart.” So he brought her into the room behind the shop
where she stained his hands and decked his wrists and plaited his
hair, after which she clad him in a slave-girl’s habit and adorned
him after the fairest fashion of woman’s adornment, till he was as
one of the Houris of the Garden of Heaven, and when she saw
him thus she exclaimed, “Blessed be Allah, best of Creators! By
Allah, thou art handsomer than the damsel.<a id="r17"></a><a href="#f17" class="c014"><sup>[17]</sup></a> Now, walk with thy
<span class="pageno" id="Page_16">16</span>left shoulder forwards and thy right well behind, and sway thy hips
from side to side.”<a id="r18"></a><a href="#f18" class="c014"><sup>[18]</sup></a> So he walked before her, as she bade him;
and, when she saw he had caught the trick of woman’s gait, she
said to him, “Expect me to-morrow night, and Allah willing, I
will take and carry thee to the palace. But when thou seest the
Chamberlains and the Eunuchs be bold, and bow thy head and
speak not with any, for I will prevent their speech; and with
Allah is success!” Accordingly, when the morning dawned, she
returned and, carrying him to the palace, entered before him and
he after her step by step. The Chamberlain would have stopped
his entering, but the old woman said to him, “O most ill-omened
of slaves, this is the handmaid of Naomi, the Caliph’s favourite.
How durst thou stay her when she would enter?” Then said
she, “Come in, O damsel!”; and the old woman went in and
they ceased not faring on, till they drew near the door leading to
the inner piazza of the palace, when she said to him, “O Ni’amah,
hearten thyself and take courage and enter and turn to the left:
then count five doors and pass through the sixth, for it is that of
the place prepared for thee. Fear nothing, and if any speak to
thee, answer not neither stop.” Then she went up with him to
the door, and the Chamberlain there on guard accosted her, saying,
“What damsel is this?”——And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of
day and ceased saying her permitted say.</p>

<div>

<div class="nf-center-c1">
<div class="nf-center c005">
    <div>Now when it was the Two Hundred and Forty-fourth Night,</div>
  </div>
</div>

</div>

<p class="c000">She said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that when the
Chamberlain accosted the old woman, saying, “What damsel is
this?”; quoth the ancient dame, “Our lady hath a mind to buy
her;” and he rejoined, “None may enter save by leave of the
Commander of the Faithful; so do thou go back with her. I cannot
let her pass for thus am I commanded.” Replied the old
woman, “O Chief Chamberlain, use thy reason. Thou knowest
that Naomi, the Caliph’s slave-girl, of whom he is enamoured, is
but now restored to health and the Commander of the Faithful
hardly yet crediteth her recovery. She is minded to buy this handmaid;
<span class="pageno" id="Page_17">17</span>so oppose thou not her entrance, lest haply it come to
Naomi’s knowledge and she be wroth with thee and suffer a
relapse and this cause thy head to be cut off.” Then said she to
Ni’amah, “Enter, O damsel; pay no heed to what he saith and
tell not the Queen-consort that her Chamberlain opposed thine
entrance.” So Ni’amah bowed his head and entered the palace,
and would have turned to the left, but mistook the direction and
walked to his right; and, meaning to count five doors and enter
the sixth, he counted six and entering the seventh, found himself
in a place whose floor was carpeted with brocade and whose walls
were hung with curtains of gold-embroidered silk. And therein
stood censers of aloes-wood and ambergris and strong-scented
musk, and at the upper end was a couch bespread with cloth of
gold on which he seated himself, marvelling at the magnificence
he saw and knowing not what was written for him in the Secret
Purpose. As he sat musing on his case, the Caliph’s sister, followed
by her handmaid, came in upon him; and, seeing the youth
seated there took him for a slave-girl and accosted him and said,
“Who art thou O damsel? and what is thy case and who brought
thee hither?” He made no reply, and was silent, when she continued,
“O damsel! if thou be one of my brother’s concubines
and he be wroth with thee, I will intercede with him for thee and
get thee grace.” But he answered her not a word; so she said to
her slave-girl, “Stand at the door and let none enter.” Then she
went up to Ni’amah and looking at him was amazed at his beauty
and said to him, “O lady, tell me who thou art and what is thy
name and how thou camest here; for I have never seen thee in
our palace.” Still he answered not, whereat she was angered and,
putting her hand to his bosom, found no breasts and would have
unveiled him, that she might know who he was; but he said to her,
“O my lady, I am thy slave and I cast myself on thy protection:
do thou protect me.” She said, “No harm shall come to thee, but
tell me who thou art and who brought thee into this my apartment.”
Answered he, “O Princess, I am known as Ni’amah bin
al-Rabi’a of Cufa and I have ventured my life for the sake of my
slave-girl Naomi, whom Al-Hajjaj took by sleight and sent hither.”
Said she, “Fear not: no harm shall befal thee;” then, calling her
maid, she said to her, “Go to Naomi’s chamber and send her to
me.” Meanwhile the old woman went to Naomi’s bedroom and
said to her, “Hath thy lord come to thee?” “No, by Allah!”
<span class="pageno" id="Page_18">18</span>answered Naomi, and the other said, “Belike he hath gone astray
and entered some chamber other than thine and lost himself.” So
Naomi cried, “There is no Majesty and there is no Might save in
Allah, the Glorious, the Great! Our last hour is come and we are all
lost.” And while they were sitting and sadly enough pondering their
case, in came the Princess’s handmaid and saluting Naomi said to
her, “My lady biddeth thee to her banquet.” “I hear and I obey,”
answered the damsel and the old woman said, “Belike thy lord is
with the Caliph’s sister and the veil of secrecy hath been rent.”
So Naomi at once sprang up and betook herself to the Princess,
who said to her, “Here is thy lord sitting with me; it seemeth he
hath mistaken the place; but, please Allah, neither thou nor he
has any cause for fear.” When Naomi heard these words, she took
heart of grace and went up to Ni’amah; and her lord when he
saw her——And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased
to say her permitted say.</p>

<div>

<div class="nf-center-c1">
<div class="nf-center c005">
    <div>Now when it was the Two Hundred and Forty-fifth Night,</div>
  </div>
</div>

</div>

<p class="c000">She said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that when
Ni’amah saw his handmaid Naomi, he rose to meet her and
strained her to his bosom and both fell to the ground fainting.
As soon as they came to themselves, the Caliph’s sister said to
them, “Sit ye down and take we counsel for your deliverance from
this your strait.” And they answered, “O our lady, we hear and
obey; it is thine to command.” Quoth she, “By Allah, no harm
shall befal you from us!” Then she bade her handmaids bring
meat and drink which was done, and they sat down and ate till
they had enough, after which they sat drinking. Then the cup
went round amongst them and their cares ceased from them; but
Ni’amah said, “Would I knew how this will end.” The Princess
asked, “O Ni’amah, dost thou love thy slave Naomi?”; and he
answered, “Of a truth it is my passion for her which hath brought
me to this state of peril for my life.” Then said she to the damsel,
“O Naomi, dost thou love thy lord Ni’amah?”; and she replied,
“O my lady, it is the love of him which hath wasted my body and
brought me to evil case.” Rejoined the Princess, “By Allah, since
ye love each other thus, may he not be who would part you! Be
of good cheer and keep your eyes cool and clear.” At this they
both rejoiced and Naomi called for a lute and, when they brought
<span class="pageno" id="Page_19">19</span>it, she took it and tuned it and played a lively measure which
enchanted the hearers, and after the prelude sang these couplets:—</p>

<div class="lg-container-b c003">
  <div class="linegroup">
    <div class="group">
      <div class="line">When the slanderers cared but to part us twain, ✿ We owed no blood-debt could raise their ire;</div>
      <div class="line">And they poured in our ears all the din of war, ✿ And aid failed and friends, when my want was dire:</div>
      <div class="line">I fought them hard with mine eyes and tears; ✿ With breath and sword, with the stream and fire!</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class="c000">Then Naomi gave the lute to her master, Ni’amah, saying, “Sing
thou to us some verse.” So he took it and playing a lively measure,
intoned these couplets:—</p>

<div class="lg-container-b c003">
  <div class="linegroup">
    <div class="group">
      <div class="line">Full Moon if unfreckled would favour thee, ✿ And Sun uneclipsed would reflect thy blee:</div>
      <div class="line">I wonder (but love is of wonders full ✿ And ardour and passion and ecstasy)</div>
      <div class="line">How short the way to my love I fare, ✿ Which, from her faring, so long I see.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class="c000">Now when he had made an end of his song, Naomi filled the cup
and gave it to him, and he took it and drank it off; then she filled
again and gave the cup to the Caliph’s sister who also emptied it;
after which the Princess in her turn took the lute and tightened
the strings and tuned it and sang these two couplets:—</p>

<div class="lg-container-b c003">
  <div class="linegroup">
    <div class="group">
      <div class="line">Grief, cark and care in my heart reside, ✿ And the fires of love in my breast abide;</div>
      <div class="line">My wasted form to all eyes shows clear; ✿ For Desire my body hath mortified.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class="c000">Then she filled the cup and gave it to Naomi, who drank it off and
taking the lute, sang these two couplets:—</p>

<div class="lg-container-b c003">
  <div class="linegroup">
    <div class="group">
      <div class="line">O to whom I gave soul which thou torturest, ✿ And in vain I’d recover from fair Unfaith,</div>
      <div class="line">Do grant thy favours my care to cure ✿ Ere I die, for this be my latest breath.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class="c000">And they ceased not to sing verses and drink to the sweet sound
of the strings, full of mirth and merriment and joy and jollity till
behold, in came the Commander of the Faithful. Now when they
saw him, they rose and kissed the ground before him; and he,
seeing Naomi with the lute in her hand, said to her, “O Naomi,
praised be Allah who hath done away from thee sickness and
<span class="pageno" id="Page_20">20</span>suffering!” Then he looked at Ni’amah (who was still disguised
as a woman), and said to the Princess, “O my sister, what damsel
is this by Naomi’s side?” She replied, “O Commander of the
Faithful, thou hast here a handmaid, one of thy concubines and
the bosom friend of Naomi who will neither eat nor drink without
her.” And she repeated the words of the poet:—</p>

<div class="lg-container-b c003">
  <div class="linegroup">
    <div class="group">
      <div class="line">Two contraries, and both concur in opposite charms, ✿ And charms so contraried by contrast lovelier show.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class="c000">Quoth the Caliph, “By Allah Omnipotent, verily she is as handsome
as Naomi, and to-morrow I will appoint her a separate
chamber beside that of her friend and send her furniture and
stuffs and all that befitteth her, in honour of Naomi.” Then the
Princess called for food and set it before her brother, who ate
and made himself at home in their place and company. Then
filling a cup he signed to Naomi to sing; so she took the lute,
after draining two of them and sang these two couplets:—</p>

<div class="lg-container-b c003">
  <div class="linegroup">
    <div class="group">
      <div class="line">Since my toper-friend in my hand hath given ✿ Three cups that brim and bubble, e’er since</div>
      <div class="line">I’ve trailed my skirts throughout night for pride ✿ As tho’, Prince of the Faithful, I were thy Prince!</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class="c000">The Prince of True Believers was delighted and filling another
cup, gave it to Naomi and bade her sing again; so after draining
the cup and sweeping the strings, she sang as follows:—</p>

<div class="lg-container-b c003">
  <div class="linegroup">
    <div class="group">
      <div class="line">O most noble of men in this time and stound, ✿ Of whom none may boast he is equal found!</div>
      <div class="line">O matchless in greatness of soul and gifts, ✿ O thou Chief, O thou King amongst all renowned:</div>
      <div class="line">Lord, who dealest large boons to the Lords of Earth, ✿ Whom thou vexest not nor dost hold them bound;</div>
      <div class="line">The Lord preserve thee, and spoil thy foes, ✿ And ne’er cease thy lot with good Fortune crowned!</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class="c000">Now when the Caliph heard these couplets, he exclaimed, “By
Allah, good! By Allah, excellent! Verily the Lord hath been
copious<a id="r19"></a><a href="#f19" class="c014"><sup>[19]</sup></a> to thee, O Naomi! How clever is thy tongue and how
<span class="pageno" id="Page_21">21</span>clear is thy speech!” And they ceased not their mirth and good
cheer till midnight, when the Caliph’s sister said to him, “Give
ear, O Commander of the Faithful to a tale I have read in books
of a certain man of rank.” “And what is this tale?” quoth he.
Quoth she “Know, O Prince of the Faithful that there lived once
in the city of Cufa a youth called Ni’amah, son of Al-Rabi’a, and
he had a slave-girl whom he loved and who loved him. They had
been reared in one bed; but when they grew up and mutual love
gat hold of them, Fortune smote them with her calamities and
Time, the tyrant, brought upon them his adversity and decreed
separation unto them. Thereupon designing and slanderous folk
enticed her by sleight forth of his house and, stealing her away
from his home, sold her to one of the Kings for ten thousand
dinars. Now the girl loved her lord even as he loved her; so he
left kith and kin and house and home and the gifts of fortune,
and set out to search for her and when she was found he devised
means to gain access to her”——And Shahrazad perceived the
dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say.</p>

<div>

<div class="nf-center-c1">
<div class="nf-center c005">
    <div>Now when it was the Two Hundred and Forty-sixth Night,</div>
  </div>
</div>

</div>

<p class="c000">She said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that the Caliph’s
sister said, “And Ni’amah ceased not absenting himself from his
kith and kin and patrial stead, that he might gain access to his
handmaid, and he incurred every peril and lavished his life till
he gained access to her, and her name was Naomi, like this slave-girl.
But the interview was short; they had not been long in
company when in came the King, who had bought her of her
kidnapper, and hastily ordered them to be slain, without doing
justice by his own soul and delaying to enquire into the matter
before the command was carried out. Now what sayest thou,
O Commander of the Faithful, of this King’s wrongous conduct?”
Answered the Caliph; “This was indeed a strange
thing: it behoved that King to pardon when he had the power
to punish; and he ought to have regarded three things in their
favour. The first was that they loved each other; the second
that they were in his house and in his grasp; and the third
that it befitteth a King to be deliberate in judging and ordering
between folk, and how much more so in cases where he himself
is concerned! Wherefore this King thus did an unkingly deed.”
<span class="pageno" id="Page_22">22</span>Then said his sister, “O my brother, by the King of the
heavens and the earth, I conjure thee, bid Naomi sing and
hearken to that she shall sing!” So he said, “O Naomi, sing to
me;” whereupon she played a lively measure and sang these
couplets:—</p>

<div class="lg-container-b c003">
  <div class="linegroup">
    <div class="group">
      <div class="line">Beguiled us Fortune who her guile displays, ✿ Smiting the heart, bequeathing thoughts that craze,</div>
      <div class="line">And parting lovers whom she made to meet, ✿ Till tears in torrent either cheek displays:</div>
      <div class="line">They were and I was and my life was glad, ✿ While Fortune often joyed to join our ways;</div>
      <div class="line">I <em>will</em> pour tear-flood, <em>will</em> rain gouts of blood, ✿ Thy loss bemoaning through the nights and days!</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class="c000">Now when the Commander of the Faithful heard this verse, he
was moved to great delight and his sister said to him, “O my
brother, whoso decideth in aught against himself, him it behoveth
to abide by it and do according to his word; and thou hast
judged against thyself by this judgement.” Then said she, “O
Ni’amah, stand up and do thou likewise up stand, O Naomi!”
So they stood up and she continued, “O Prince of True Believers,
she who standeth before thee is Naomi the stolen, whom Al-Hajjaj
bin Yusuf al-Sakafi kidnapped and sent to thee, falsely pretending
in his letter to thee that he had bought her for ten thousand gold
pieces. And this other who standeth before thee is her lord,
Ni’amah, son of Al-Rabi’a; and I beseech thee, by the honour
of thy pious forebears and by Hamzah and Ukayl and Abbas,<a id="r20"></a><a href="#f20" class="c014"><sup>[20]</sup></a>
to pardon them both and overlook their offence and bestow them
one on the other, that thou mayst win rich reward in the next
world of thy just dealing with them; for they are under thy
hand and verily they have eaten of thy meat and drunken of
thy drink; and behold, I make intercession for them and beg of
thee the boon of their blood.” Thereupon quoth the Caliph,
“Thou speakest sooth: I did indeed give judgement as thou sayst,
and I am not one to pass sentence and to revoke it.” Then
said he, “O Naomi, say, be this thy lord?” And she answered,
“Even so, O Commander of the Faithful.” Then quoth he, “No
harm shall befal you, I give you each to other;” adding to the
<span class="pageno" id="Page_23">23</span>young man, “O Ni’amah, who told thee where she was and
taught thee how to get at this place?” He replied, “O Commander
of the Faithful, hearken to my tale and give ear to my
history; for, by the virtue of thy pious forefathers, I will hide
nothing from thee!” And he told him all that had passed
between himself and the Persian physician and the old nurse, and
how she had brought him into the palace and he had mistaken
the doors; whereat the Caliph wondered with exceeding wonder
and said, “Fetch me the Persian.” So they brought him into the
presence and he was made one of his chief officers. Moreover the
King bestowed on him robes of honour and ordered him a handsome
present, saying, “When a man hath shown like this man
such artful management, it behoveth us to make him one of our
chief officers.” The Caliph also loaded Ni’amah and Naomi with
gifts and honours and rewarded the old nurse; and they abode
with him seven days in joy and content and all delight of life,
when Ni’amah craved leave to return to Cufa with his slave-girl.
The Caliph gave them permission and they departed and arrived
in due course at Cufa, where Ni’amah was restored to his father
and mother, and they abode in all the joys and jollities of life,
till there came to them the Destroyer of delights and the Sunderer
of societies. Now when Amjad and As’ad heard from Bahram
this story, they marvelled with extreme marvel and said, “By
Allah, this is indeed a rare tale!”——And Shahrazad perceived
the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say.</p>

<div class="nf-center c005">
    <div>Now when it was the Two Hundred and Forty-seventh Night,</div>
  </div>
</div>

</div>

<p class="c000">She said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that when
Amjad and As’ad heard this story from Bahram the Magian who
had become a Moslem, they marvelled with extreme marvel and
thus passed that night; and when the next morning dawned, they
mounted and riding to the palace, sought an audience of the King
who granted it and received them with high honour. Now as they
were sitting together talking, of a sudden they heard the townsfolk
crying aloud and shouting to one another and calling for
help; and the Chamberlain came in to the King and said to
him, “Some King hath encamped before the city, he and his host,
with arms and weapons displayed, and we know not their object
and aim.” The King took counsel with his Wazir Amjad and his
<span class="pageno" id="Page_24">24</span>brother As’ad; and Amjad said, “I will go out to him and learn
the cause of his coming.” So he took horse and, riding forth
from the city, repaired to the stranger’s camp, where he found the
King and with him a mighty many and mounted Mamelukes.
When the guards saw him, they knew him for an envoy from the
King of the city; so they took him and brought him before their
Sultan. Then Amjad kissed the ground before him; but lo! the
King was a Queen, who was veiled with a mouth-veil, and she
said to Amjad, “Know that I have no design on this your city
and that I am come hither only in quest of a beardless slave of
mine, whom if I find with you, I will do you no harm; but if I
find him not, then shall there befal sore onslaught between me
and you.” Asked Amjad, “O Queen, what like is thy slave and
what is his story and what may be his name?” Said she, “His
name is As’ad and my name is Marjanah, and this slave came to
my town in company of Bahram, a Magian, who refused to sell
him to me; so I took him by force, but his master fell upon him
by night and bore him away by stealth and he is of such and such
a favour.” When Amjad heard that, he knew it was indeed his
brother As’ad whom she sought and said to her, “O Queen of the
age, Alhamdolillah, praised be Allah, who hath brought us relief!
Verily this slave whom thou seekest is my brother.” Then he
told her their story and all that had befallen them in the land of
exile, and acquainted her with the cause of their departure from
the Islands of Ebony, whereat she marvelled and rejoiced to have
found As’ad. So she bestowed a dress of honour upon Amjad,
and he returned forthright to the King and told him what had
passed, at which they all rejoiced and the King went forth with
Amjad and As’ad to meet Queen Marjanah. When they were
admitted to her presence and sat down to converse with her and
were thus pleasantly engaged, behold, a dust-cloud rose and flew
and grew, till it walled the view. And after a while it lifted and
showed beneath it an army dight for victory, in numbers like the
swelling sea, armed and armoured cap-à-pie who, making for the
city, encompassed it around as the ring encompasseth the little
finger;<a id="r21"></a><a href="#f21" class="c014"><sup>[21]</sup></a> and a bared brand was in every hand. When Amjad
<span class="pageno" id="Page_25">25</span>and As’ad saw this, they exclaimed, “Verily to Allah we belong
and to Him we shall return! What is this mighty host? Doubtless,
these are enemies, and except we agree with this Queen
Marjanah to fight them, they will take the town from us and slay
us. There is no resource for us but to go out to them and see
who they are.” So Amjad arose and took horse and passed
through the city-gate to Queen Marjanah’s camp; but when he
reached the approaching army he found it to be that of his grandsire,
King Ghayur, father of his mother Queen Budur.——And
Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted

    <div>Now when it was the Two Hundred and Forty-eighth Night,</div>
  </div>
</div>

</div>

<p class="c000">She said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that when
Amjad reached the approaching host, he found it to be that of his
grandsire, Lord of the Isles and the Seas and the Seven Castles;
and when he went into the presence, he kissed the ground between
his hands and delivered to him the message. Quoth the King,
“My name is King Ghayur and I come wayfaring in quest of my
daughter Budur whom fortune hath taken from me; for she left
me and returned not to me, nor have I heard any tidings of her
or of her husband Kamar al-Zaman. Have ye any news of
them?” When Amjad heard this, he hung his head towards the
ground for a while in thought till he felt assured that this King
was none other than his grandfather, his mother’s father; whereupon
he raised his head and, kissing ground before him, told him
that he was the son of his daughter Budur; on hearing which
<span class="pageno" id="Page_26">26</span>Ghayur threw himself upon him and they both fell a-weeping.<a id="r22"></a><a href="#f22" class="c014"><sup>[22]</sup></a>
Then said Ghayur, “Praised be Allah, O my son, for safety, since
I have foregathered with thee,” and Amjad told him that his
daughter Budur was safe and sound, and her husband Kamar
al-Zaman likewise, and acquainted him that both abode in a
city called the City of Ebony. Moreover, he related to him
how his father, being wroth with him and his brother, had commanded
that both be put to death, but that his treasurer had
taken pity on them and let them go with their lives. Quoth King
Ghayur, “I will go back with thee and thy brother to your father
and make your peace with him.” So Amjad kissed the ground
before him in huge delight and the King bestowed a dress of
honour upon him, after which he returned, smiling, to the King of
the City of the Magians and told him what he had learnt from
King Ghayur, whereat he wondered with exceeding wonder.
Then he despatched guest-gifts of sheep and horses and camels
and forage and so forth to King Ghayur, and did the like by
Queen Marjanah; and both of them told her what chanced;
whereupon quoth she, “I too will accompany you with my troops
and will do my endeavour to make this peace.” Meanwhile
behold, there arose another dust-cloud and flew and grew till it
walled the view and blackened the day’s bright hue; and under
it they heard shouts and cries and neighing of steeds and beheld
sword glance and the glint of levelled lance. When this new
host drew near the city and saw the two other armies, they beat
their drums and the King of the Magians exclaimed, “This is
indeed naught but a blessed day. Praised be Allah who hath
made us of accord with these two armies; and if it be His will,
He shall give us peace with yon other as well.” Then said he to
Amjad and As’ad, “Fare forth and fetch us news of these troops,
for they are a mighty host, never saw I a mightier.” So they
opened the city gates, which the King had shut for fear of the
beleaguering armies, and Amjad and As’ad went forth and, coming
<span class="pageno" id="Page_27">27</span>to the new host, found that it was indeed a mighty many. But
as soon as they came to it behold, they knew that it was the
army of the King of the Ebony Islands, wherein was their father,
King Kamar al-Zaman in person. Now when they looked upon
him, they kissed ground and wept; but, when he beheld them,
he threw himself upon them weeping, with sore weeping, and
strained them to his breast for a full hour. Then he excused
himself to them and told them what desolation he had suffered for
their loss and exile; and they acquainted him with King Ghayur’s
arrival, whereupon he mounted with his chief officers and taking
with him his two sons, proceeded to that King’s camp. As
they drew near, one of the Princes rode forward and informed
King Ghayur of Kamar al-Zaman’s coming, whereupon he came
out to meet him and they joined company, marvelling at these
things and how they had chanced to foregather in that place.
Then the townsfolk made them banquets of all manner meats and
sweetmeats and presented to them horses and camels and fodder
and other guest-gifts and all that the troops needed. And while
this was doing, behold, yet another cloud of dust arose and flew
till it walled the view, whilst earth trembled with the tramp of
steed and tabors sounded like stormy winds. After a while, the
dust lifted and discovered an army clad in coats of mail and
armed cap-à-pie; but all were in black garb, and in their midst
rode a very old man whose beard flowed down over his breast and
he also was clad in black. When the King in the city and the
city-folk saw this great host, he said to the other Kings, “Praised
be Allah by whose omnipotent command ye are met here, all
in one day, and have proved all known one to the other! But
what vast and victorious army is this which hemmeth in the whole
land like a wall?” They answered, “Have no fear of them; we
are three Kings, each with a great army, and if they be enemies,
we will join thee in doing battle with them, were they three times
as many as they now are.” Meanwhile, up came an envoy from
the approaching host, making for the city. So they brought him
before Kamar al-Zaman, King Ghayur, Queen Marjanah and the
King of the city; and he kissed the ground and said, “My liege
lord cometh from Persia-land; for many years ago he lost his
son and he is seeking him in all countries. If he find him with
you, well and good; but if he find him not, there will be war
between him and you and he will waste your city.” Rejoined
Kamar al-Zaman, “It shall not come to that; but how is thy
<span class="pageno" id="Page_28">28</span>master called in Aiam land?” Answered the envoy, “He is
called King Shahriman, lord of the Khalidan Islands; and he hath
levied these troops in the lands traversed by him, whilst seeking
his son.” Now when Kamar al-Zaman heard these words, he
cried out with a great cry and fell down in a fainting fit which
lasted a long while; and anon coming to himself he wept bitter
tears and said to Amjad and As’ad, “Go ye, O my sons, with the
herald, salute your grandfather and my father, King Shahriman,
and give him glad tidings of me, for he mourneth my loss and
even to the present time he weareth black raiment for my sake.”
Then he told the other Kings all that had befallen him in the
days of his youth, at which they wondered and, going down with
him from the city, repaired to his father, whom he saluted, and
they embraced and fell to the ground senseless for excess of
joy. And when they revived after a while, Kamar al-Zaman
acquainted his father with all his adventures and the other Kings
saluted Shahriman. Then, after having married Marjanah to
As’ad, they sent her back to her kingdom, charging her not to
cease correspondence with them; so she took leave and went her
way. Moreover they married Amjad to Bostan, Bahram’s daughter,
and they all set out for the City of Ebony. And when they
arrived there, Kamar al-Zaman went in to his father-in-law, King
Armanus, and told him all that had befallen him and how he had
found his sons; whereat Armanus rejoiced and gave him joy of
his safe return. Then King Ghayur went in to his daughter,
Queen Budur,<a id="r23"></a><a href="#f23" class="c014"><sup>[23]</sup></a> and saluted her and quenched his longing for her
company, and they all abode a full month’s space in the City
of Ebony; after which the King and his daughter returned to
their own country.——And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day
and ceased to say her permitted say.</p>

the first Abbaside, made it his Capital and it became a famous seat of Moslem learning;

(A.D.). He was Governor of Al-Hijaz and Al-Irak under the fifth and sixth Ommiades,
and I have noticed his vigorous rule of the Moslems’ Holy Land in my Pilgrimage
(iii. 194, etc.). He pulled down the Ka’abah and restored it to the condition in which it
now is. Al-Siyuti (p. 219) accuses him of having suborned a man to murder Ibn Omar
with a poisoned javelin, and of humiliating the Prophet’s companions by “sealing them
in the necks and hands,” that is he tied a thong upon the neck of each and sealed the
knot with lead. In Irak he showed himself equally masterful; but an iron hand was
required by the revolutionists of Kufah and Basrah. He behaved like a good Knight
in rescuing the Moslem women who called upon his name when taken prisoners by
Dahir of Debal (Tathá in Sind). Al-Hajjaj was not the kind of man the Caliph would
have chosen for a pander; but the Shi’ahs hated him and have given him a lasting bad
name. In the East men respect manly measures, not the hysterical, philanthropic
pseudo-humanitarianism of our modern government which is really the cruellest of all.
When Ziyád bin Abihi was sent by Caliph Mu’awiyah to reform Bassorah, a den of
thieves, he informed the lieges that he intended to rule by the sword and advised all
evil-doers to quit the city. The people were forbidden, under pain of death, to walk
the streets after prayers; on the first night two hundred suffered; on the second five
and none afterwards. Compare this with our civilised rule in Egypt where even
bands of brigands, a phenomenon perfectly new and unknown to this century, have
started up, where crime has doubled in quantity and quality, and where “Christian
rule” has thoroughly scandalised a Moslem land.</p>

She is found in the cities of Southern Europe, ever pious, ever prayerful; and she

<p class="c000"><span class="label"><a href="#r21">21</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>The Eastern ring is rarely plain; and, its use being that of a signet, it is always in
intaglio: the Egyptians invented engraving hieroglyphics on wooden stamps for marking
bricks and applied the process to the ring. Moses B.C. 1491 (Exod. xxviii. 9) took two
onyx-stones, and graved on them the names of the children of Israel. From this the
signet ring was but a step. Herodotus mentions an emerald seal set in gold, that of
Polycrates, the work of Theodorus son of Telecles the Samian (iii. 141). The Egyptians
also were perfectly acquainted with working in cameo (anaglyph) and rilievo, as may be
seen in the cavo rilievo of the finest of their hieroglyphs. The Greeks borrowed from
them the cameo and applied it to gems (<i><span xml:lang="la" lang="la">e.g.</span></i> Tryphon’s in the Marlborough collection),
and they bequeathed the art to the Romans. We read in a modern book “Cameo
means an onyx, and the most famous cameo in the world is the onyx containing the
Apotheosis of Augustus.” The ring is given in marriage because it was a seal by which
orders were signed (Gen. xxxviii. 18 and Esther iii. 10-12). I may note that the seal-ring
of Cheops (Khufu), found in the Greatest Pyramid, was in the possession of my old
friend, Doctor Abbott, of Auburn (U.S.), and was sold with his collection. It is the
oldest ring in the world, and settles the Cheops-question.</p>

  <h2 id="c29" class="c007">ALA AL-DIN ABU AL-SHAMAT.”<a id="r24"></a><a href="#f24" class="c014"><sup>[24]</sup></a></h2>
</div>

<p class="c013">“What is that?” asked he, and she said, It hath reached me
that there lived, in times of yore and years and ages long gone
before, a merchant of Cairo<a id="r25"></a><a href="#f25" class="c014"><sup>[25]</sup></a> named Shams al-Din, who was of the
best and truest-spoken of the traders of the city; and he had
eunuchs and servants and negro-slaves and handmaids and Mamelukes
and great store of money. Moreover, he was Consul<a id="r26"></a><a href="#f26" class="c014"><sup>[26]</sup></a> of
the Merchants of Cairo and owned a wife, whom he loved and who
loved him; except that he had lived with her forty years, yet had
not been blessed with a son or even a daughter. One day, as he
sat in his shop, he noted that the merchants, each and every, had
a son or two sons or more sitting in their shops like their sires.
Now the day being Friday; he entered the Hammam-bath and
made the total ablution: after which he came out and took the
barber’s glass and looked in it, saying, “I testify that there is no
god but <em>the</em> God and I testify that Mohammed is the Messenger of
God!” Then he considered his beard and, seeing that the white
hairs in it covered the black, bethought himself that hoariness is
the harbinger of death. Now his wife knew the time of his coming
home and had washed and made herself ready for him, so when
<span class="pageno" id="Page_30">30</span>he came in to her, she said, “Good evening,” but he replied “I
see no good.” Then she called to the handmaid, “Spread the
supper-tray;” and when this was done quoth she to her husband,
“Sup, O my lord.” Quoth he, “I will eat nothing,” and pushing
the tray away with his foot, turned his back upon her. She asked,
“Why dost thou thus? and what hath vexed thee?”; and he
answered, “Thou art the cause of my vexation.”——And Shahrazad
perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted
say.</p>

<div>

<div class="nf-center-c1">
<div class="nf-center c005">
    <div>Now when it was the Two Hundred and Fiftieth Night,</div>
  </div>
</div>

</div>

<p class="c000">She said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that Shams
al-Din said to his wife, “Thou art the cause of my vexation.” She
asked, “Wherefore?” and he answered, “When I opened my
shop this morning, I saw that each and every of the merchants
had with him a son or two sons or more, sitting in their shops like
their fathers; and I said to myself:—He who took thy sire will not
spare thee. Now the night I first visited thee,<a id="r27"></a><a href="#f27" class="c014"><sup>[27]</sup></a> thou madest me
swear that I would never take a second wife over thee nor a concubine,
Abyssinian or Greek or handmaid of other race; nor would
lie a single night away from thee: and behold, thou art barren,
and having thee is like boring into the rock.” Rejoined she,
“Allah is my witness that the fault lies with thee, for that thy
seed is thin.” He asked, “And what showeth the man whose
semen is thin?” And she answered, “He cannot get women with
child, nor beget children.” Quoth he, “What thickeneth the
seed? tell me and I will buy it: haply, it will thicken mine.”
Quoth she, “Enquire for it of the druggists.” So he slept with her
that night and arose on the morrow, repenting of having spoken
angrily to her; and she also regretted her cross words. Then
he went to the market and, finding a druggist, saluted him; and
when his salutation was returned said to him, “Say, hast thou
with thee a seed-thickener?” He replied, “I had it, but am out
of it: enquire thou of my neighbour.” Then Shams al-Din
made the round till he had asked every one, but they all laughed
at him, and presently he returned to his shop and sat down, sore
<span class="pageno" id="Page_31">31</span>troubled. Now there was in the bazar a man who was Deputy
Syndic of the brokers and was given to the use of opium and
electuary and green hashísh.<a id="r28"></a><a href="#f28" class="c014"><sup>[28]</sup></a> He was called Shaykh Mohammed
Samsam and being poor he used to wish Shams al-Din good
morrow every day. So he came to him according to his custom
and saluted him. The merchant returned his salute, but in ill-temper,
and the other, seeing him vexed, said, “O my lord, what
hath crossed thee?” Thereupon Shams al-Din told him all that
occurred between himself and his wife, adding, “These forty years
have I been married to her yet hath she borne me neither son nor
daughter; and they say:—The cause of thy failure to get her with
child is the thinness of thy seed; so I have been seeking a something
wherewith to thicken my semen but found it not.” Quoth
Shaykh Mohammed, “O my lord, I have a seed-thickener, but
what wilt thou say to him who causeth thy wife to conceive by thee
after these forty years have passed?” Answered the merchant,
“If thou do this, I will work thy weal and reward thee.” “Then
give me a dinar,” rejoined the broker, and Shams al-Din said,
“Take these two dinars.” He took them and said, “Give me
also yonder big bowl of porcelain.” So he gave it to him and the
<span class="pageno" id="Page_32">32</span>broker betook himself to a hashish-seller, of whom he bought two
ounces of concentrated Roumi opium and equal parts of Chinese
cubebs, cinnamon, cloves, cardamoms, ginger, white pepper and
mountain skink<a id="r29"></a><a href="#f29" class="c014"><sup>[29]</sup></a>; and, pounding them all together, boiled them
in sweet olive-oil; after which he added three ounces of male
frankincense in fragments and a cupful of coriander-seed; and,
macerating the whole, made it into an electuary with Roumi bee-honey.
Then he put the confection in the bowl and carried it
to the merchant, to whom he delivered it, saying, “Here is the
seed-thickener, and the manner of using it is this. Take of my
electuary with a spoon after supping, and wash it down with a
sherbet made of rose conserve; but first sup off mutton and house-pigeon
plentifully seasoned and hotly spiced.” So the merchant
bought all this and sent the meat and pigeons to his wife, saying;
“Dress them deftly and lay up the seed-thickener until I want it
and call for it.” She did his bidding and, when she served up the
meats, he ate the evening meal, after which he called for the bowl
and ate of the electuary. It pleased him well, so he ate the rest
and knew his wife. That very night she conceived by him and,
after three months, her courses ceased, no blood came from her
and she knew that she was with child. When the days of her
pregnancy were accomplished, the pangs of labour took her and
they raised loud lullilooings and cries of joy. The midwife delivered
her with difficulty, by pronouncing over the boy at his
birth the names of Mohammed and Ali, and said, “Allah is Most
Great!”; and she called in his ear the call to prayer. Then she
<span class="pageno" id="Page_33">33</span>wrapped him up and passed him to his mother, who took him and
gave him the breast; and he sucked and was full and slept. The
midwife abode with them three days, till they had made the
mothering-cakes of sugared bread and sweetmeats; and they
distributed them on the seventh day. Then they sprinkled salt
against the evil eye and the merchant, going in to his wife, gave
her joy of her safe delivery, and said, “Where is Allah’s deposit?”
So they brought him a babe of surpassing beauty, the handiwork
of the Orderer who is ever present and, though he was but seven
days old, those who saw him would have deemed him a yearling
child. So the merchant looked on his face and, seeing it like a
shining full moon, with moles on either cheek, said he to his wife,
“What hast thou named him?” Answered she, “If it were a girl
I had named her; but this is a boy, so none shall name him but
thou.” Now the people of that time used to name their children
by omens; and, whilst the merchant and his wife were taking
counsel of the name, behold, one said to his friend, “Ho my lord,
Ala al-Din!” So the merchant said, “We will call him Ala al-Din
Abú al-Shámát.”<a id="r30"></a><a href="#f30" class="c014"><sup>[30]</sup></a> Then he committed the child to the nurse, and
he drank milk two years, after which they weaned him and he
grew up and throve and walked upon the floor. When he came
to seven years old, they put him in a chamber under a trap-door,
for fear of the evil eye, and his father said, “He shall not come out,
till his beard grow.” So he gave him in charge to a handmaid
and a blackamoor; the girl dressed him his meals and the slave
carried them to him. Then his father circumcised him and made
him a great feast; after which he brought him a doctor of the
law, who taught him to write and read and repeat the Koran, and
other arts and sciences, till he became a good scholar and an
accomplished. One day it so came to pass that the slave, after
<span class="pageno" id="Page_34">34</span>bringing him the tray of food went away and left the trap-door
open: so Ala al-Din came forth from the vault and went in to his
mother, with whom was a company of women of rank. As they
sat talking, behold, in came upon them the youth as he were a
white slave drunken<a id="r31"></a><a href="#f31" class="c014"><sup>[31]</sup></a> for the excess of his beauty; and when
they saw him, they veiled their faces and said to his mother, “Allah
requite thee, O such an one! How canst thou let this strange
Mameluke in upon us? Knowest thou not that modesty is a
point of the Faith?” She replied, “Pronounce Allah’s name<a id="r32"></a><a href="#f32" class="c014"><sup>[32]</sup></a>
and cry Bismillah! this is my son, the fruit of my vitals and the
heir of Consul Shams al-Din, the child of the nurse and the collar
and the crust and the crumb.”<a id="r33"></a><a href="#f33" class="c014"><sup>[33]</sup></a> Quoth they, “Never in our days
knew we that thou hadst a son”; and quoth she, “Verily his father
feared for him the evil eye and reared him in an under-ground
chamber;”——And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and
ceased saying her permitted say.</p>

<div class="nf-center c005">
    <div>Now when it was the Two Hundred and Fifty-first Night,</div>
  </div>
</div>

</div>

<p class="c000">She said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that Ala-al-Din’s
mother said to her lady-friends, “Verily his father feared
for him the evil eye and reared him in an under-ground chamber;
and haply the slave forgot to shut the door and he fared forth;
but we did not mean that he should come out, before his beard
was grown.” The women gave her joy of him, and the youth went
out from them into the court yard where he seated himself in the
open sitting-room; and behold, in came the slaves with his father’s
she-mule, and he said to them, “Whence cometh this mule?”
Quoth they, “We escorted thy father when riding her to the shop,
and we have brought her back.” He asked, “What may be my
father’s trade?”; and they answered, “Thy father is Consul of
the merchants in the land of Egypt and Sultan of the Sons of the
Arabs.” Then he went in to his mother and said to her, “O my
mother, what is my father’s trade?” Said she, “O my son, thy
sire is a merchant and Consul of the merchants in the land of
<span class="pageno" id="Page_35">35</span>Egypt and Sultan of the Sons of the Arabs. His slaves consult
him not in selling aught whose price is less than one thousand gold
pieces, but merchandise worth him an hundred and less they sell
at their own discretion; nor doth any merchandise whatever, little
or muchel, leave the country without passing through his hands
and he disposeth of it as he pleaseth; nor is a bale packed and
sent abroad amongst folk but what is under his disposal. And
Almighty Allah, O my son, hath given thy father monies past
compt.” He rejoined, “O my mother, praised be Allah, that I am
son of the Sultan of the Sons of the Arabs and that my father is
Consul of the merchants! But why, O my mother, do ye put
me in the under-ground chamber and leave me prisoner there?”
Quoth she, “O my son, we imprisoned thee not save for fear of
folks’ eyes: ‘the evil eye is a truth,’<a id="r34"></a><a href="#f34" class="c014"><sup>[34]</sup></a> and most of those in their long
homes are its victims.” Quoth he, “O my mother, and where is
a refuge-place against Fate? Verily care never made Destiny
forbear, nor is there flight from what is written for every wight.
He who took my grandfather will not spare myself nor my father;
for, though he live to-day he shall not live to-morrow. And when
my father dieth and I come forth and say:—I am Ala al-Din, son
of Shams al-Din the merchant, none of the people will believe
me, but men of years and standing will say:—In our lives never
saw we a son or a daughter of Shams al-Din. Then the public
Treasury will come down and take my father’s estate, and Allah
have mercy on him who said:—The noble dieth and his wealth
passeth away, and the meanest of men take his women. Therefore,
O my mother, speak thou to my father, that he carry me with
him to the bazar and open for me a shop; so may I sit there with
my merchandise and teach me to buy and sell and take and give.”
Answered his mother, “O my son, as soon as thy sire returneth
I will tell him this.” So when the merchant came home, he found
his son Ala al-Din Abu al-Shamat sitting with his mother and said
to her, “Why hast thou brought him forth of the under-ground
chamber?” She replied, “O son of my uncle, it was not I that
brought him out; but the servants forgot to shut the door and
left it open; so, as I sat with a company of women of rank, behold,
he came forth and walked in to me.” Then she went on to repeat
to him his son’s words; so he said, “O my son, to-morrow,
<span class="pageno" id="Page_36">36</span>Inshallah! I will take thee with me to the bazar; but, my
boy, sitting in markets and shops demandeth good manners and
courteous carriage in all conditions.” Ala al-Din passed the night
rejoicing in his father’s promise and, when the morrow came, the
merchant carried him to the Hammam and clad him in a suit
worth a mint of money. As soon as they had broken their fast
and drunk their sherbets, Shams al-Din mounted his she-mule and
putting his son upon another, rode to the market, followed by his
boy. But when the market-folk saw their Consul making towards
them, foregoing a youth as he were a slice of the full moon on
the fourteenth night, they said, one to other, “See thou yonder boy
behind the Consul of the merchants; verily, we thought well of
him, but he is, like the leek, gray of head and green at heart.”<a id="r35"></a><a href="#f35" class="c014"><sup>[35]</sup></a>
And Shaykh Mohammed Samsam, Deputy Syndic of the market,
the man before mentioned, said to the dealers, “O merchants, we
will not keep the like of him for our Shaykh; no, never!” Now
it was the custom anent the Consul when he came from his house
of a morning and sat down in his shop, for the Deputy Syndic
of the market to go and recite to him and to all the merchants
assembled around him the Fátihah or opening chapter of the
Koran,<a id="r36"></a><a href="#f36" class="c014"><sup>[36]</sup></a> after which they accosted him one by one and wished
him good morrow and went away, each to his business-place. But
when Shams al-Din seated himself in his shop that day as usual,
the traders came not to him as accustomed; so he called the
Deputy and said to him, “Why come not the merchants together
as usual?” Answered Mohammed Samsam, “I know not how to
tell thee these troubles, for they have agreed to depose thee from
<span class="pageno" id="Page_37">37</span>the Shaykh-ship of the market and to recite the Fatihah to thee
no more.” Asked Shams al-Din, “What may be their reason?”;
and asked the Deputy, “What boy is this that sitteth by thy side
and thou a man of years and chief of the merchants? Is this lad
a Mameluke or akin to thy wife? Verily, I think thou lovest him
and inclinest lewdly to the boy.” Thereupon the Consul cried out
at him, saying, “Silence, Allah curse thee, genus and species!
This is my son.” Rejoined the Deputy, “Never in our born
days have we seen thee with a son,” and Shams al-Din answered,
“When thou gavest me the seed-thickener, my wife conceived and
bare this youth; but I reared him in a souterrain for fear of the
evil eye, nor was it my purpose that he should come forth, till he
could take his beard in his hand.<a id="r37"></a><a href="#f37" class="c014"><sup>[37]</sup></a> However, his mother would
not agree to this, and he on his part begged I would stock him a
shop and teach him to sell and buy.” So the Deputy Syndic
returned to the other traders and acquainted them with the truth
of the case, whereupon they all arose to accompany him; and,
going in a body to Shams al-Din’s shop, stood before him and
recited the “Opener” of the Koran; after which they gave him
joy of his son and said to him, “The Lord prosper root and
branch! But even the poorest of us, when son or daughter is
born to him, needs must cook a pan-full of custard<a id="r38"></a><a href="#f38" class="c014"><sup>[38]</sup></a> and bid his
friends and kith and kin; yet hast thou not done this.” Quoth
he, “This I owe you; be our meeting in the garden.”——And
Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her
permitted say.</p>

<div>

<div class="nf-center-c1">
<div class="nf-center c005">
    <div>Now when it was the Two Hundred and Fifty-second Night,</div>
  </div>
</div>

</div>

<p class="c000">Her sister Dunyazad said to her, “Pray continue thy story for us,
an thou be awake and not inclined to sleep.” Quoth she:—With
pleasure and goodwill: it hath reached me, O auspicious King,
that the Consul of the merchants promised them a banquet and
said “Be our meeting in the garden.” So when morning dawned
he despatched the carpet-layer to the saloon of the garden-pavilion
<span class="pageno" id="Page_38">38</span>and bade him furnish the two. Moreover, he sent thither all that
was needful for cooking, such as sheep and clarified butter and so
forth, according to the requirements of the case; and spread two
tables, one in the pavilion and another in the saloon. Then Shams
al-Din and his boy girded themselves, and he said to Ala al-Din
“O my son, whenas a greybeard entereth, I will meet him and
seat him at the table in the pavilion; and do thou, in like manner,
receive the beardless youths and seat them at the table in the
saloon.” He asked, “O my father, why dost thou spread two
tables, one for men and another for youths?”; and he answered,
“O my son, the beardless is ashamed to eat with the bearded.”
And his son thought this his answer full and sufficient. So when
the merchants arrived, Shams al-Din received the men and seated
them in the pavilion, whilst Ala al-Din received the youths and
seated them in the saloon. Then the food was set on and the
guests ate and drank and made merry and sat over their wine,
whilst the attendants perfumed them with the smoke of scented
woods, and the elders fell to conversing of matters of science
and traditions of the Prophet. Now there was amongst them a
merchant called Mahmúd of Balkh, a professing Moslem but at
heart a Magian, a man of lewd and mischievous life who loved
boys. And when he saw Ala al-Din from whose father he used
to buy stuffs and merchandise, one sight of his face sent him a
thousand sighs and Satan dangled the jewel before his eyes, so
that he was taken with love-longing and desire and affection and
his heart was filled with mad passion for him. Presently he arose
and made for the youths, who stood up to receive him; and at
this moment Ala al-Din being taken with an urgent call of
Nature, withdrew to make water; whereupon Mahmud turned
to the other youths and said to them, “If ye will incline Ala
al-Din’s mind to journeying with me, I will give each of you a
dress worth a power of money.” Then he returned from them
to the men’s party; and, as the youths were sitting, Ala al-Din
suddenly came back, when all rose to receive him and seated
him in the place of highest honour. Presently, one of them said
to his neighbour, “O my lord Hasan, tell me whence came to
thee the capital whereon thou tradest.” He replied, “When I
grew up and came to man’s estate, I said to my sire:—O my
father, give me merchandise. Quoth he:—O my son, I have none
by me; but go thou to some merchant and take of him money
and traffic with it; and so learn to buy and sell, give and take.
<span class="pageno" id="Page_39">39</span>So I went to one of the traders and borrowed of him a thousand
dinars, wherewith I bought stuffs and carrying them to Damascus,
sold them there at a profit of two for one. Then I bought Syrian
stuffs and carrying them to Aleppo, made a similar gain of them;
after which I bought stuffs of Aleppo and repaired with them to
Baghdad, where I sold them with like result, two for one; nor
did I cease trading upon my capital till I was worth nigh ten
thousand ducats.” Then each of the others told his friend some
such tale, till it came to Ala al-Din’s turn to speak, when they
said to him, “And thou, O my lord Ala al-Din?” Quoth he, “I
was brought up in a chamber under-ground and came forth from
it only this week; and I do but go to the shop and return home
from the shop.” They remarked, “Thou art used to wone at
home and wottest not the joys of travel, for travel is for men
only.” He replied, “I reck not of voyaging and wayfaring doth
not tempt me.” Whereupon quoth one to the other, “This one
is like the fish: when he leaveth the water he dieth.” Then
they said to him, “O Ala al-Din, the glory of the sons of the
merchants is not but in travel for the sake of gain.” Their talk
angered him; so he left them weeping-eyed and heavy-hearted
and mounting his mule returned home. Now his mother saw
him in tears and in bad temper and asked him, “What hath
made thee weep, O my son?”; and he answered, “Of a truth,
all the sons of the merchants put me to shame and said:—Naught
is more glorious for a merchant’s son than travel for
gain and to get him gold.”——And Shahrazad perceived the
dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say.</p>

<div>

<div class="nf-center-c1">
<div class="nf-center c005">
    <div>Now when it was the Two Hundred and Fifty-third Night,</div>
  </div>
</div>

</div>

<p class="c000">She said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that Ala al-Din
said to his mother, “Of a truth all the sons of the merchants
put me to shame and said:—Naught is more honourable for a
merchant’s son than travel for gain.” “O my son, hast thou a
mind to travel?” “Even so!” “And whither wilt thou go?” “To
the city of Baghdad; for there folk make double the cost price
on their goods.” “O my son, thy father is a very rich man and,
if he provide thee not with merchandise, I will supply it out of
my own monies.” “The best favour is that which is soonest
<span class="pageno" id="Page_40">40</span>bestowed; if this kindness is to be, now is the time.” So she
called the slaves and sent them for cloth-packers; then, opening
a store-house, brought out ten loads of stuffs, which they made
up into bales for him. Such was his case; but as regards his
father, Shams al-Din, he looked about and failed to find Ala
al-Din in the garden and enquiring after him, was told that he
had mounted mule and gone home; so he too mounted and
followed him. Now when he entered the house, he saw the
bales ready bound and asked what they were; whereupon his
wife told him what had chanced between Ala al-Din and the
sons of the merchants; and he cried, “O my son, Allah’s malison
on travel and stranger-hood! Verily Allah’s Apostle (whom
the Lord bless and preserve!) hath said:—It is of a man’s happy
fortune that he eat his daily bread in his own land; and it was
said of the ancients:—Leave travel, though but for a mile.” Then
quoth he to his son, “Say, art thou indeed resolved to travel and
wilt thou not turn back from it?” Quoth the other, “There is no
help for it but that I journey to Baghdad with merchandise, else
will I doff clothes and don dervish gear and fare a-wandering over
the world.” Shams al-Din rejoined, “I am no penniless pauper but
have great plenty of wealth;” then he showed him all he owned of
monies and stuffs and stock-in-trade and observed, “With me
are stuffs and merchandise befitting every country in the world.”
Then he showed him among the rest, forty bales ready bound, with
the price, a thousand dinars, written on each, and said, “O my son
take these forty loads, together with the ten which thy mother
gave thee, and set out under the safeguard of Almighty Allah.
But, O my child, I fear for thee a certain wood in thy way, called
the Lion’s Copse,<a id="r39"></a><a href="#f39" class="c014"><sup>[39]</sup></a> and a valley hight the Vale of Dogs, for there
lives are lost without mercy.” He said, “How so, O my father?”;
and he replied, “Because of a Badawi bandit named Ajlán.”
Quoth Ala al-Din, “Such is Allah’s luck; if any share of it be
mine, no harm shall hap to me.” Then they rode to the cattle-bazar,
where behold, a cameleer<a id="r40"></a><a href="#f40" class="c014"><sup>[40]</sup></a> alighted from his she-mule and
kissing the Consul’s hand, said to him, “O my lord, it is long, by
<span class="pageno" id="Page_41">41</span>Allah, since thou hast employed us in the way of business.” He
replied, “Every time hath its fortune and its men,<a id="r41"></a><a href="#f41" class="c014"><sup>[41]</sup></a> and Allah have
ruth on him who said:—</p>

<div class="lg-container-b c003">
  <div class="linegroup">
    <div class="group">
      <div class="line">And the old man crept o’er the worldly ways ✿ So bowed, his beard o’er his knees down flow’th:</div>
      <div class="line">Quoth I:—What gars thee so doubled go? ✿ Quoth he (as to me his hands he show’th)</div>
      <div class="line">My youth is lost, in the dust it lieth; ✿ And see, I bend me to find my youth.”<a id="r42"></a><a href="#f42" class="c014"><sup>[42]</sup></a></div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class="c000">Now when he had ended his verses, he said, “O chief of the
caravan, it is not I who am minded to travel, but this my son.”
Quoth the cameleer, “Allah save him for thee.” Then the Consul
made a contract between Ala al-Din and the man, appointing that
the youth should be to him as a son, and gave him into his charge,
saying, “Take these hundred gold pieces for thy people.” Moreover
he bought his son threescore mules and a lamp and a tomb-covering
for the Sayyid Abd al-Kadir of Gílán<a id="r43"></a><a href="#f43" class="c014"><sup>[43]</sup></a> and said to him,
“O my son, while I am absent, this is thy sire in my stead:
whatsoever he biddeth thee, do thou obey him.” So saying, he
returned home with the mules and servants and that night they
made a Khitmah or perlection of the Koran and held a festival in
honour of the Shaykh Abd al-Kadir al-Jiláni. And when the
morrow dawned, the Consul gave his son ten thousand dinars,
saying, “O my son, when thou comest to Baghdad, if thou find
stuffs easy of sale, sell them; but if they be dull, spend of these
dinars.” Then they loaded the mules and, taking leave of one
another, all the wayfarers setting out on their journey, marched
forth from the city. Now Mahmud of Balkh had made ready his
own venture for Baghdad and had moved his bales and set up his
tents without the walls, saying in himself, “Thou shalt not enjoy
this youth but in the desert, where there is neither spy nor marplot
to trouble thee.” It chanced that he had in hand a thousand
<span class="pageno" id="Page_42">42</span>dinars which he owed to the youth’s father, the balance of a
business-transaction between them; so he went and bade farewell
to the Consul, who charged him, “Give the thousand dinars to my
son Ala al-Din;” and commended the lad to his care, saying, “He
is as it were thy son.” Accordingly, Ala al-Din joined company
with Mahmud of Balkh——And Shahrazad perceived the dawn
of day and ceased to say her permitted say.</p>

<div>

<div class="nf-center-c1">
<div class="nf-center c005">
    <div>Now when it was the Two Hundred and Fifty-fourth Night,</div>
  </div>
</div>

</div>

<p class="c000">She said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King that Ala al-Din
joined company with Mahmud of Balkh who, before beginning the
march, charged the youth’s cook to dress nothing for him, but himself
provided him and his company with meat and drink. Now
he had four houses, one in Cairo, another in Damascus, a third in
Aleppo and a fourth in Baghdad. So they set out and ceased not
journeying over waste and wold till they drew near Damascus,
when Mahmud sent his slave to Ala al-Din, whom he found sitting
and reading. He went up to him and kissed his hands, and Ala
al-Din having asked him what he wanted, he answered, “My
master saluteth thee and craveth thy company to a banquet at his
place.” Quoth the youth, “Not till I consult my father Kamál
al-Din, the captain of the caravan.” So he asked advice of the
Makaddam,<a id="r44"></a><a href="#f44" class="c014"><sup>[44]</sup></a> who said, “Do not go.” Then they left Damascus
and journeyed on till they came to Aleppo, where Mahmud made
a second entertainment and sent to invite Ala al-Din; but he consulted
the Chief Cameleer who again forbade him. Then they
marched from Aleppo and fared on, till there remained between
them and Baghdad only a single stage. Here Mahmud prepared
a third feast and sent to bid Ala al-Din to it: Kamal al-Din once
more forbade his accepting it, but he said, “I must needs go.” So
he rose and, slinging a sword over his shoulder, under his clothes,
repaired to the tent of Mahmud of Balkh, who came to meet him
and saluted him. Then he set before him a sumptuous repast and
they ate and drank and washed hands. At last Mahmud bent
towards Ala al-Din to snatch a kiss from him, but the youth
<span class="pageno" id="Page_43">43</span>received the kiss on the palm of his hand and said to him, “What
wouldest thou be at?” Quoth Mahmud, “In very sooth I brought
thee hither that I might take my pleasure with thee in this
jousting-ground, and we will comment upon the words of him who
saith:—</p>

<div class="lg-container-b c003">
  <div class="linegroup">
    <div class="group">
      <div class="line">Say, canst not come to us one momentling, ✿ Like milk of ewekin or aught glistening,</div>
      <div class="line">And eat what liketh thee of dainty cate, ✿ And take thy due of fee in silverling,</div>
      <div class="line">And bear whatso thou wilt, without mislike, ✿ Of spanling, fistling or a spanlong thing?”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class="c000">Then Mahmud of Balkh would have laid hands on Ala al-Din to
ravish him; but he rose and baring his brand, said to him,
“Shame on thy gray hairs! Hast thou no fear of Allah, and
He of exceeding awe?<a id="r45"></a><a href="#f45" class="c014"><sup>[45]</sup></a> May He have mercy on him who
saith:—</p>

<div class="lg-container-b c003">
  <div class="linegroup">
    <div class="group">
      <div class="line">Preserve thy hoary hairs from soil and stain, ✿ For whitest colours are the easiest stained!”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class="c000">And when he ended his verses he said to Mahmud of Balkh,
“Verily this merchandise<a id="r46"></a><a href="#f46" class="c014"><sup>[46]</sup></a> is a trust from Allah and may not be
sold. If I sold this property to other than thee for gold, I would
sell it to thee for silver; but by Allah, O filthy villain, I will never
again company with thee; no, never!” Then he returned to
Kamal al-Din the guide and said to him, “Yonder man is a
lewd fellow, and I will no longer consort with him nor suffer his
company by the way.” He replied, “O my son, did I not say to
thee:—Go not near him? But if we part company with him, I
fear destruction for ourselves; so let us still make one caravan.”
But Ala al-Din cried, “It may not be that I ever again travel
with him.” So he loaded his beasts and journeyed onwards, he
and his company, till they came to a valley, where Ala al-Din
would have halted, but the Cameleer said to him, “Do not halt
here; rather let us fare forwards and press our pace, so haply we
make Baghdad before the gates are closed, for they open and shut
<span class="pageno" id="Page_44">44</span>them with the sun, in fear lest the Rejectors<a id="r47"></a><a href="#f47" class="c014"><sup>[47]</sup></a> should take the city
and throw the books of religious learning into the Tigris.” But
Ala al-Din replied to him, “O my father, I came not forth from
home with this merchandise, or travelled hither for the sake of
traffic, but to divert myself with the sight of foreign lands and
folks;” and he rejoined, “O my son, we fear for thee and for thy
goods from the wild Arabs.” Whereupon the youth answered,
“Harkye, fellow, art thou master or man? I will not enter
Baghdad till the morning, that the sons of the city may see my
merchandise and know me.” “Do as thou wilt,” said the other;
“I have given thee the wisest advice, but thou art the best judge of
thine own case.” Then Ala al-Din bade them unload the mules
and pitch the tent; so they did his bidding and abode there till
the middle of the night, when he went out to obey a call of
nature and suddenly saw something gleaming afar off. So he
said to Kamal al-Din, “O captain, what is yonder glittering?”
The Cameleer sat up and, considering it straitly, knew it for the
glint of spear-heads and the steel of Badawi weapons and swords.
And lo and behold! this was a troop of wild Arabs under a
chief called Ajlán Abú Náib, Shaykh of the Arabs, and when they
neared the camp and saw the bales and baggage, they said one to
another, “O night of loot!” Now when Kamal al-Din heard
these their words he cried, “Avaunt, O vilest of Arabs!” But
Abu Naib so smote him with his throw-spear in the breast, that
the point came out gleaming from his back, and he fell down dead
at the tent-door. Then cried the water-carrier,<a id="r48"></a><a href="#f48" class="c014"><sup>[48]</sup></a> “Avaunt, O
foulest of Arabs!” and one of them smote him with a sword upon
the shoulder, that it issued shining from the tendons of the throat,
and he also fell down dead. (And all this while Ala al-Din
stood looking on.) Then the Badawin surrounded and charged
the caravan from every side and slew all Ala al-Din’s company
without sparing a man: after which they loaded the mules with
the spoil and made off. Quoth Ala al-Din to himself, “Nothing
will slay thee save thy mule and thy dress!”; so he arose and
put off his gown and threw it over the back of a mule, remaining
in his shirt and bag-trousers only; after which he looked towards
the tent-door and, seeing there a pool of gore flowing from the
slaughtered, wallowed in it with his remaining clothes till he was
as a slain man drowned in his own blood. Thus it fared with
him; but as regards the Shaykh of the wild Arabs, Ajlan, he said
to his banditti, “O Arabs, was this caravan bound from Egypt for
Baghdad or from Baghdad for Egypt?”——And Shahrazad perceived
the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say.</p>

    <div>Now when it was the Two Hundred and Fifty-fifth Night,</div>
  </div>
</div>

</div>

<p class="c000">She said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King that when the
Badawi asked his banditti, “O Arabs, was this caravan bound
from Egypt for Baghdad or from Baghdad for Egypt?”; they
answered, “’Twas bound from Egypt for Baghdad;” and he said,
“Return ye to the slain, for methinks the owner of this caravan is
not dead.” So they turned back to the slain and fell to prodding
and slashing them with lance and sword till they came to Ala
al-Din, who had thrown himself down among the corpses. And
when they came to him, quoth they, “Thou dost but feign thyself
dead, but we will make an end of thee,” and one of the Badawin
levelled his javelin and would have plunged it into his breast
when he cried out, “Save me, O my lord Abd al-Kadir, O Saint
of Gilan!” and behold, he saw a hand turn the lance away from
his breast to that of Kamal al-Din the cameleer, so that it pierced
him and spared himself.<a id="r49"></a><a href="#f49" class="c014"><sup>[49]</sup></a> Then the Arabs made off; and, when
Ala al-Din saw that the birds were flown with their god-send, he
sat up and finding no one, rose and set off running; but, behold
Abu Náib the Badawi looked back and said to his troop, “I see
somewhat moving afar off, O Arabs!” So one of the bandits
<span class="pageno" id="Page_46">46</span>turned back and, spying Ala al-Din running, called out to him,
saying, “Flight shall not forward thee and we after thee;” and
he smote his mare with his heel and she hastened after him.
Then Ala al-Din seeing before him a watering tank and a cistern
beside it, climbed up into a niche in the cistern and, stretching
himself at full length, feigned to be asleep and said, “O gracious
Protector, cover me with the veil of Thy protection which may
not be torn away!” And lo! the Badawi came up to the cistern
and, standing in his stirrup-irons put out his hand to lay hold
of Ala al-Din; but he said, “O my lady Nafísah<a id="r50"></a><a href="#f50" class="c014"><sup>[50]</sup></a>! Now is thy
time!” And behold, a scorpion stung the Badawi in the palm
and he cried out, saying, “Help, O Arabs! I am stung;” and he
alighted from his mare’s back. So his comrades came up to him
and mounted him again, asking, “What hath befallen thee?”
whereto he answered, “A young scorpion<a id="r51"></a><a href="#f51" class="c014"><sup>[51]</sup></a> stung me.” So they
departed, with the caravan. Such was their case; but as regards
Ala al-Din, he tarried in the niche, and Mahmud of Balkh bade
load his beasts and fared forwards till he came to the Lion’s Copse
where he found Ala al-Din’s attendants all lying slain. At this
he rejoiced and went on till he reached the cistern and the
reservoir. Now his mule was athirst and turned aside to drink,
but she saw Ala al-Din’s shadow in the water and shied and
started; whereupon Mahmud raised his eyes and, seeing Ala
al-Din lying in the niche, stripped to his shirt and bag-trousers,
said to him, “What man this deed to thee hath dight and left thee
in this evil plight?” Answered Ala al-Din, “The Arabs,” and
Mahmud said, “O my son, the mules and the baggage were thy
ransom; so do thou comfort thyself with his saying who said:—</p>

<div class="lg-container-b c003">
  <div class="linegroup">
    <div class="group">
      <div class="line">If thereby man can save his head from death, ✿ His good is worth him but a slice of nail!</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class="c000">But now, O my son, come down and fear no hurt.” Thereupon he
<span class="pageno" id="Page_47">47</span>descended from the cistern-niche and Mahmud mounted him on a
mule, and they fared on till they reached Baghdad, where he
brought him to his own house and carried him to the bath, saying
to him, “The goods and money were the ransom of thy life, O my
son; but, if thou wilt hearken to me, I will give thee the worth of
that thou hast lost, twice told.” When he came out of the bath,
Mahmud carried him into a saloon decorated with gold with four
raised floors, and bade them bring a tray with all manner of meats.
So they ate and drank and Mahmud bent towards Ala al-Din
to snatch a kiss from him; but he received it upon the palm
of his hand and said, “What, dost thou persist in thy evil designs
upon me? Did I not tell thee that, were I wont to sell this
merchandise to other than thee for gold, I would sell it thee
for silver?” Quoth Mahmud, “I will give thee neither merchandise
nor mule nor clothes save at this price; for I am gone
mad for love of thee, and bless him who said:—</p>

<div class="lg-container-b c003">
  <div class="linegroup">
    <div class="group">
      <div class="line">Told us, ascribing to his Shaykhs, our Shaykh ✿ Abú Bilál, these words they wont to utter:<a id="r52"></a><a href="#f52" class="c014"><sup>[52]</sup></a></div>
      <div class="line">Unhealed the lover wones of love desire, ✿ By kiss and clip; his only cure’s to futter!”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class="c000">Ala al-Din replied, “Of a truth this may never be, take back thy
dress and thy mule and open the door that I may go out.” So he
opened the door, and Ala al-Din fared forth and walked on, with
the dogs barking at his heels, and he went forwards through the
dark when behold, he saw the door of a mosque standing open
and, entering the vestibule, there took shelter and concealment;
and suddenly a light approached him and on examining it he saw
that it came from a pair of lanthorns borne by two slaves before
two merchants. Now one was an old man of comely face and the
other a youth; and he heard the younger say to the elder, “O my
uncle, I conjure thee by Allah, give me back my cousin!” The
old man replied, “Did I not forbid thee, many a time, when the
oath of divorce was always in thy mouth, as it were Holy Writ?”
Then he turned to his right and, seeing Ala al-Din as he were
a slice of the full moon, said to him, “Peace be with thee! who art
thou, O my son?” Quoth he, returning the salutation of peace,
“I am Ala al-Din, son of Shams al-Din, Consul of the merchants
<span class="pageno" id="Page_48">48</span>for Egypt. I besought my father for merchandise; so he packed
me fifty loads of stuffs and goods,”——And Shahrazad perceived
the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say.</p>

<div>

<div class="nf-center-c1">
<div class="nf-center c005">
    <div>Now when it was the Two Hundred and Fifty-sixth Night,</div>
  </div>
</div>

</div>

<p class="c000">She said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that Ala al-Din
continued, “So he packed me fifty loads of goods and gave me
ten thousand dinars, wherewith I set out for Baghdad; but when
I reached the Lion’s Copse, the wild Arabs came out against
me and took all my goods and monies. So I entered the city
knowing not where to pass the night and, seeing this place, I took
shelter here.” Quoth the old man, “O my son, what sayest thou
to my giving thee a thousand dinars and a suit of clothes and a
mule worth other two thousand?” Ala al-Din asked, “To what
end wilt thou give me these things, O my uncle?” and the other
answered, “This young man who accompanieth me, is the son of
my brother and an only son; and I have a daughter called Zubaydah<a id="r53"></a><a href="#f53" class="c014"><sup>[53]</sup></a>
the lutist, an only child who is a model of beauty and loveliness,
so I married her to him. Now he loveth her, but she loatheth
him; and when he chanced to take an oath of triple divorcement
and broke it, forthright she left him. Whereupon he egged on
all the folk to intercede with me to restore her to him; but I told
him that this could not lawfully be save by an intermediate
marriage, and we have agreed to make some stranger the intermediary<a id="r54"></a><a href="#f54" class="c014"><sup>[54]</sup></a>
in order that none may taunt and shame him with this
affair. So, as thou art a stranger, come with us and we will marry
thee to her; thou shalt lie with her to-night and on the morrow
divorce her and we will give thee what I said.” Quoth Ala al-Din
<span class="pageno" id="Page_49">49</span>to himself, “By Allah, to bide the night with a bride on a bed
in a house is far better than sleeping in the streets and vestibules!”
So he went with them to the Kazi whose heart, as
soon as he saw Ala al-Din, was moved to love him, and who said
to the old man, “What is your will?” He replied, “We wish to
make this young man an intermediary husband for my daughter;
but we will write a bond against him binding him to pay down by
way of marriage-settlement ten thousand gold pieces. Now if
after passing the night with her he divorce her in the morning, we
will give him a mule and dress each worth a thousand dinars, and
a third thousand of ready money; but if he divorce her not, he
shall pay down the ten thousand dinars according to contract.”
So they agreed to the agreement and the father of the bride to be
received his bond for the marriage-settlement. Then he took Ala
al-Din and, clothing him anew, carried him to his daughter’s house
and there he left him standing at the door, whilst he himself went
in to the young lady and said, “Take the bond of thy marriage-settlement,
for I have wedded thee to a handsome youth by name
Ala al-Din Abu al-Shamat: so do thou use him with the best of
usage.” Then he put the bond into her hands and left her and
went to his own lodging. Now the lady’s cousin had an old
duenna who used to visit Zubaydah, and he had done many a
kindness to this woman, so he said to her, “O my mother, if my
cousin Zubaydah see this handsome young man, she will never
after accept my offer; so I would fain have thee contrive some
trick to keep her and him apart.” She answered, “By the life of
thy youth,<a id="r55"></a><a href="#f55" class="c014"><sup>[55]</sup></a> I will not suffer him to approach her!” Then she
went to Ala al-Din and said to him, “O my son, I have a word of
advice to give thee, for the love of Almighty Allah and do thou
accept my counsel, as I fear for thee from this young woman: better
thou let her lie alone and feel not her person nor draw thee near
to her.” He asked, “Why so?”; and she answered, “Because her
body is full of leprosy and I dread lest she infect thy fair and
seemly youth.” Quoth he, “I have no need of her.” Thereupon she
went to the lady and said the like to her of Ala al-Din; and she
replied, “I have no need of him, but will let him lie alone, and on
the morrow he shall gang his gait.” Then she called a slave-girl
and said to her, “Take the tray of food and set it before him that
he may sup.” So the handmaid carried him the tray of food and
<span class="pageno" id="Page_50">50</span>set it before him and he ate his fill: after which he sat down and
raised his charming voice and fell to reciting the chapter called
Y. S.<a id="r56"></a><a href="#f56" class="c014"><sup>[56]</sup></a> The lady listened to him and found his voice as melodious
as the psalms of David sung by David himself,<a id="r57"></a><a href="#f57" class="c014"><sup>[57]</sup></a> which when she
heard, she exclaimed, “Allah disappoint the old hag who told me
that he was affected with leprosy! Surely this is not the voice of
one who hath such a disease; and all was a lie against him.”<a id="r58"></a><a href="#f58" class="c014"><sup>[58]</sup></a>
Then she took a lute of India-land workmanship and, tuning the
strings, sang to it in a voice so sweet its music would stay the
birds in the heart of heaven; and began these two couplets:—</p>

<div class="lg-container-b c003">
  <div class="linegroup">
    <div class="group">
      <div class="line">I love a fawn with gentle white-black eyes, ✿ Whose walk the willow-wand with envy kills:</div>
      <div class="line">Forbidding me he bids for rival mine, ✿ Tis Allah’s grace who grants to whom He wills!</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class="c000">And when he heard her chant these lines he ended his recitation
of the chapter, and began also to sing and repeated the following
couplet:—</p>

<div class="lg-container-b c003">
  <div class="linegroup">
    <div class="group">
      <div class="line">My Salám to the Fawn in the garments concealed, ✿ And to roses in gardens of cheek revealed.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class="c000">The lady rose up when she heard this, and her inclination for him
redoubled and she lifted the curtain; and Ala al-Din, seeing her,
recited these two couplets:—</p>

<div class="lg-container-b c003">
  <div class="linegroup">
    <div class="group">
      <div class="line">She shineth forth, a moon, and bends, a willow-wand, ✿ And breathes out ambergris, and gazes, a gazelle.</div>
      <div class="line">Meseems as if grief loved my heart and when from her ✿ Estrangement I abide possession to it fell.<a id="r59"></a><a href="#f59" class="c014"><sup>[59]</sup></a></div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class="c000">Thereupon she came forward, swinging her haunches and gracefully
swaying a shape the handiwork of Him whose boons are hidden;
and each of them stole one glance of the eyes that cost them
<span class="pageno" id="Page_51">51</span>a thousand sighs. And when the shafts of the two regards which
met rankled in his heart, he repeated these two couplets:—</p>

<div class="lg-container-b c003">
  <div class="linegroup">
    <div class="group">
      <div class="line">She ‘spied the moon of Heaven, reminding me ✿ Of nights when met we in the meadows li’en:</div>
      <div class="line">True, both saw moons, but sooth to say, it was ✿ Her very eyes I saw, and she my eyne.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class="c000">And when she drew near him, and there remained but two paces
between them, he recited these two couplets:—</p>

<div class="lg-container-b c003">
  <div class="linegroup">
    <div class="group">
      <div class="line">She spread three tresses of unplaited hair ✿ One night, and showed me nights not one but four;</div>
      <div class="line">And faced the moon of Heaven with her brow, ✿ And showed me two-fold moons in single hour.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class="c000">And as she was hard by him he said to her, “Keep away from
me, lest thou infect me.” Whereupon she uncovered her wrist<a id="r60"></a><a href="#f60" class="c014"><sup>[60]</sup></a> to
him, and he saw that it was cleft, as it were in two halves, by its
veins and sinews and its whiteness was as the whiteness of virgin
silver. Then said she, “Keep away from me, thou! for thou art
stricken with leprosy, and may be thou wilt infect me.” He
asked, “Who told thee I was a leper?” and she answered, “The
old woman so told me.” Quoth he, “’Twas she told me also that
thou wast afflicted with white scurvy;” and so saying, he bared
his forearms and showed her that his skin was also like virgin
silver. Thereupon she pressed him to her bosom and he pressed
her to his bosom and the twain embraced with closest embrace,
then she took him and, lying down on her back, let down her
petticoat-trousers, and in an instant that which his father had left
him rose up in rebellion against him and he said, “Go it, O
Shaykh Zachary<a id="r61"></a><a href="#f61" class="c014"><sup>[61]</sup></a> of shaggery, O father of veins!”; and putting
both hands to her flanks, he set the sugar-stick<a id="r62"></a><a href="#f62" class="c014"><sup>[62]</sup></a> to the mouth of
the cleft and thrust on till he came to the wicket called “Pecten.”
His passage was by the Gate of Victories<a id="r63"></a><a href="#f63" class="c014"><sup>[63]</sup></a> and therefrom he entered
<span class="pageno" id="Page_52">52</span>the Monday market, and those of Tuesday and Wednesday and
Thursday,<a id="r64"></a><a href="#f64" class="c014"><sup>[64]</sup></a> and, finding the carpet after the measure of the daïs-floor,<a id="r65"></a><a href="#f65" class="c014"><sup>[65]</sup></a>
he plied the box within its cover till he came to the end of
it. And when morning dawned he cried to her, “Alas for delight
which is not fulfilled! The raven<a id="r66"></a><a href="#f66" class="c014"><sup>[66]</sup></a> taketh it and flieth away!”
She asked, “What meaneth this saying?”; and he answered, “O
my lady, I have but this hour to abide with thee.” Quoth she,
“Who saith so?” and quoth he, “Thy father made me give him a
written bond to pay ten thousand dinars to thy wedding-settlement;
and, except I pay it this very day, they will imprison me
for debt in the Kazi’s house; and now my hand lacketh one half-dirham
of the sum.” She asked, “O my lord, is the marriage-bond
in thy hand or in theirs?”; and he answered, “O my lady, in mine,
but I have nothing.” She rejoined, “The matter is easy; fear
thou nothing. Take these hundred dinars: an I had more, I would
give thee what thou lackest; but of a truth my father, of his love
for my cousin, hath transported all his goods, even to my jewellery,
from my lodging to his. But when they send thee a serjeant of
the Ecclesiastical Court,”——And Shahrazad perceived the dawn
of day and ceased to say her permitted say.</p>

<div>

<div class="nf-center-c1">
<div class="nf-center c005">
    <div>Now when it was the Two Hundred and Fifty-seventh Night,</div>
  </div>
</div>

</div>

<p class="c000">She said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that the young
lady rejoined to Ala al-Din, “And when they send thee at an early
hour a serjeant of the Ecclesiastical Court, and the Kazi and my
father bid thee divorce me, do thou reply, By what law is it lawful
<span class="pageno" id="Page_53">53</span>and right that I should marry at nightfall and divorce in the
morning? Then kiss the Kazi’s hand and give him a present,
and in like manner kiss the Assessors’ hands and give each of
them ten gold pieces. So they will all speak with thee, and if they
ask thee, Why dost thou not divorce her and take the thousand
dinars and the mule and suit of clothes, according to contract duly
contracted? do thou answer, Every hair of her head is worth a
thousand ducats to me and I will never put her away, neither will
I take a suit of clothes nor aught else. And if the Kazi say to
thee, Then pay down the marriage settlement, do thou reply, I am
short of cash at this present; whereupon he and the Assessors will
deal in friendly fashion with thee and allow thee time to pay.”
Now whilst they were talking, behold, the Kazi’s officer knocked
at the door; so Ala al-Din went down and the man said to him,
“Come, speak the Efendi,<a id="r67"></a><a href="#f67" class="c014"><sup>[67]</sup></a> for thy father-in-law summoneth
thee.” So Ala al-Din gave him five dinars and said to him,
“O Summoner, by what law am I bound to marry at nightfall
and divorce next morning?” The serjeant answered, “By no law
of ours at all, at all; and if thou be ignorant of the religious law, I
will act as thine advocate.” Then they went to the divorce-court
and the Kazi said to Ala al-Din, “Why dost thou not put away
the woman and take what falleth to thee by the contract?”
Hearing this he went up to the Kazi; and, kissing his hand, put
fifty dinars in it and said, “O our lord the Kazi, by what law is it
lawful and right that I should marry at nightfall and divorce in
the morning in my own despite?” The Kazi answered, “Divorce
on compulsion and by force is sanctioned by no school of the
Moslems.” Then said the young lady’s father, “If thou wilt not
divorce, pay me the ten thousand dinars, her marriage-settlement.”
Quoth Ala al-Din, “Give me a delay of three days;” but the Kazi
said, “Three days is not time enough; he shall give thee ten.” So
they agreed to this and bound him after ten days either to pay the
dowry or to divorce her. And after consenting he left them and
taking meat and rice and clarified butter<a id="r68"></a><a href="#f68" class="c014"><sup>[68]</sup></a> and what else of food he
needed, returned to the house and told the young woman all that
had passed; whereupon she said, “’Twixt night and day, wonders
may display; and Allah bless him for his say:—</p>

<div class="lg-container-b c003">
  <div class="linegroup">
    <div class="group">
      <div class="line"><span class="pageno" id="Page_54">54</span>Be mild when rage shall come to afflict thy soul; ✿ Be patient when calamity breeds ire;</div>
      <div class="line">Lookye, the Nights are big with child by Time, ✿ Whose pregnancy bears wondrous things and dire.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class="c000">Then she rose and made ready food and brought the tray, and
they two ate and drank and were merry and mirthful. Presently,
Ala al-Din besought her to let him hear a little music; so she took
the lute and played a melody that had made the hardest stone
dance for glee, and the strings cried out in present ecstacy, “O
Loving One!”;<a id="r69"></a><a href="#f69" class="c014"><sup>[69]</sup></a> after which she passed from the adagio into the
presto and a livelier measure. As they thus spent their leisure in
joy and jollity and mirth and merriment, behold, there came a
knocking at the door and she said to him; “Go see who is at the
door.” So he went down and opened it and finding four Dervishes
standing without, said to them, “What want ye?” They replied,
“O my lord, we are foreign and wandering religious mendicants,
the viands of whose souls are music and dainty verse, and we would
fain take our pleasure with thee this night till morning doth
appear, when we will wend our way, and with Almighty Allah be
thy reward; for we adore music and there is not one of us but
knoweth by heart store of odes and songs and ritornellos.”<a id="r70"></a><a href="#f70" class="c014"><sup>[70]</sup></a> He
answered, “There is one I must consult;” and he returned and
told Zubaydah who said, “Open the door to them.” So he
brought them up and made them sit down and welcomed them;
then he fetched them food, but they would not eat and said, “O
our lord, our meat is to repeat Allah’s name in our hearts and to
hear music with our ears: and bless him who saith:—</p>

<div class="lg-container-b c003">
  <div class="linegroup">
    <div class="group">
      <div class="line">Our aim is only converse to enjoy, ✿ And eating joyeth only cattle-kind.<a id="r71"></a><a href="#f71" class="c014"><sup>[71]</sup></a></div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class="c000">And just now we heard pleasant music in thy house, but when
we entered, it ceased; and fain would we know whether the
player was a slave-girl, white or black, or a maiden of good
family.” He answered, “It was this my wife,” and told them
all that had befallen him, adding, “Verily my father-in-law hath
<span class="pageno" id="Page_55">55</span>bound me to pay a marriage settlement of ten thousand dinars
for her, and they have given me ten days’ time.” Said one of
the Dervishes, “Have no care and think of naught but good;
for I am Shaykh of the Convent and have forty Dervishes
under my orders. I will presently collect from them the ten
thousand dinars and thou shalt pay thy father-in-law the wedding
settlement. But now bid thy wife make us music that we may
be gladdened and pleasured; for to some folk music is meat,
to others medicine and to others refreshing as a fan.” Now these
four Dervishes were none other than the Caliph Harun al-Rashid,
his Wazir Ja’afar the Barmecide, Abu al-Nowás al-Hasan son of
Háni<a id="r72"></a><a href="#f72" class="c014"><sup>[72]</sup></a> and Masrur the sworder; and the reason of their coming
to the house was that the Caliph, being heavy at heart, had
summoned his Minister and said, “O Wazir! it is our will to go
down to the city and pace its streets, for my breast is sore
straitened.” So they all four donned dervish-dress and went
down and walked about, till they came to that house where,
hearing music, they were minded to know the cause. They
spent the night in joyance and harmony and telling tale after
tale until morning dawned, when the Caliph laid an hundred
gold pieces under the prayer-carpet and all taking leave of Ala
al-Din, went their way. Now when Zubaydah lifted the carpet
she found beneath it the hundred dinars and she said to her
husband, “Take these hundred dinars which I have found under
the prayer-carpet; assuredly the Dervishes when about to leave
us laid them there, without our knowledge.” So Ala al-Din
took the money and, repairing to the market, bought therewith
meat and rice and clarified butter and all they required. And
when it was night, he lit the wax-candles and said to his wife,
“The mendicants, it is true, have not brought the ten thousand
dinars which they promised me; but indeed they are poor men.”
As they were talking, behold, the Dervishes knocked at the door
<span class="pageno" id="Page_56">56</span>and she said, “Go down and open to them.” So he did her
bidding and bringing them up, said to them, “Have you brought
me the ten thousand dinars you promised me?” They answered,
“We have not been able to collect aught thereof as yet; but
fear nothing: Inshallah, to-morrow we will compound for thee
some alchemical cookery. But now bid thy wife play us her very
best pieces and gladden our hearts for we love music.” So she
took her lute and made them such melody that had caused the
hardest rocks to dance with glee; and they passed the night
in mirth and merriment, converse and good cheer, till morn
appeared with its sheen and shone, when the Caliph laid an
hundred gold pieces under the prayer-carpet and all, after taking
leave of Ala al-Din, went their way. And they ceased not to
visit him thus every night for nine nights; and each morning
the Caliph put an hundred dinars under the prayer-carpet, till
the tenth night, when they came not. Now the reason of their
failure to come was that the Caliph had sent to a great merchant,
saying to him, “Bring me fifty loads of stuffs, such as come
from Cairo,”——And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and
ceased saying her permitted say.</p>

<div>

<div class="nf-center-c1">
<div class="nf-center c005">
    <div>Now when it was the Two Hundred and Fifty-eighth Night,</div>
  </div>
</div>

</div>

<p class="c000">She said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that the Prince
of True Believers said to that merchant, “Bring me fifty loads
of stuffs such as come from Cairo, and let each one be worth a
thousand dinars, and write on each bale its price; and bring me
also a male Abyssinian slave.” The merchant did the bidding
of the Caliph who committed to the slave a basin and ewer of
gold and other presents, together with the fifty loads; and wrote
a letter to Ala al-Din as from his father Shams al-Din and said to
him, “Take these bales and what else is with them, and go to such
and such a quarter wherein dwelleth the Provost of the merchants
and say:—Where be Ala al-Din Abu al-Shamat? till folk direct
thee to his quarter and his house.” So the slave took the letter
and the goods and what else and fared forth on his errand. Such
was his case; but as regards Zubaydah’s cousin and first husband,
he went to her father and said to him, “Come let us go to Ala
al-Din and make him divorce the daughter of my uncle.” So
they set out both together and, when they came to the street
<span class="pageno" id="Page_57">57</span>in which the house stood, they found fifty he-mules laden with
bales of stuffs, and a blackamoor riding on a she-mule. So they
said to him, “Whose loads are these?” He replied, “They belong
to my lord Ala al-Din Abu al-Shamat; for his father equipped
him with merchandise and sent him on a journey to Baghdad-city;
but the wild Arabs came forth against him and took his money
and goods and all he had. So when the ill news reached his
father, he despatched me to him with these loads, in lieu of those
he had lost; besides a mule laden with fifty thousand dinars, a
parcel of clothes worth a power of money, a robe of sables<a id="r73"></a><a href="#f73" class="c014"><sup>[73]</sup></a> and
a basin and ewer of gold.” Whereupon the lady’s father said,
“He whom thou seekest is my son-in-law and I will show thee
his house.” Meanwhile Ala al-Din was sitting at home in huge
concern, when lo! one knocked, at the door and he said, “O
Zubaydah, Allah is all-knowing! but I fear thy father hath sent
me an officer from the Kazi or the Chief of Police.” Quoth she,
“Go down and see what it is.” So he went down; and, opening
the door, found his father-in-law, the Provost of the merchants
with an Abyssinian slave, dusky-complexioned and pleasant of
favour, riding on a mule. When the slave saw him he dismounted
and kissed his hands; and Ala al-Din said, “What dost thou
want?” He replied, “I am the slave of my lord Ala al-Din Abu
al-Shamat, son of Shams al-Din, Consul of the merchants for
the land of Egypt, who hath sent me to him with this charge.”
Then he gave him the letter and Ala al-Din opening it found
written what followeth:<a id="r74"></a><a href="#f74" class="c014"><sup>[74]</sup></a>—</p>

<div class="lg-container-b c003">
  <div class="linegroup">
    <div class="group">
      <div class="line">Ho thou my letter! when my friend shall see thee, ✿ Kiss thou the ground and buss his sandal-shoon:</div>
      <div class="line">Look thou hie softly and thou hasten not; ✿ My life and rest are in those hands so boon.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class="c000">“After hearty salutions and congratulations and high estimation
from Shams al-Din to his son, Abu al-Shamat. Know, O my son,
that news hath reached me of the slaughter of thy men and the
plunder of thy monies and goods; so I send thee herewith fifty
loads of Egyptian stuffs, together with a suit of clothes and a robe
<span class="pageno" id="Page_58">58</span>of sables and a basin and ewer of gold. Fear thou no evil and
the goods thou hast lost were the ransom of thy life; so regret
them not and may no further grief befal thee. Thy mother and
the people of the house are doing well in health and happiness and
all greet thee with abundant greetings. Moreover, O my son, it
hath reached me that they have married thee, by way of intermediary,
to the lady Zubaydah the Lutist and they have imposed
on thee a marriage-settlement of ten thousand dinars; wherefore
I send thee also fifty thousand dinars by the slave Salím.”<a id="r75"></a><a href="#f75" class="c014"><sup>[75]</sup></a> Now
when Ala al-Din had made an end of reading the letter, he took
possession of the loads and, turning to the Provost, said to him,
“O my father-in-law, take the ten thousand dinars, the marriage-settlement
of thy daughter Zubaydah, and take also the loads of
goods and dispose of them, and thine be the profit; only return me
the cost-price.” He answered, “Nay, by Allah, I will take nothing;
and, as for thy wife’s settlement, do thou settle the matter with
her.” Then, after the goods had been brought in, they went to
Zubaydah and she said to her sire, “O my father, whose loads
be these?” He said, “These belong to thy husband, Ala al-Din:
his father hath sent them to him instead of those whereof the wild
Arabs spoiled him. Moreover, he hath sent him fifty thousand
dinars with a parcel of clothes, a robe of sables, a she-mule for
riding and a basin and ewer of gold. As for the marriage-settlement
that is for thy recking.” Thereupon Ala al-Din rose and,
opening the money-box, gave her her settlement and the lady’s
cousin said, “O my uncle, let him divorce to me my wife;” but
the old man replied, “This may never be now; for the marriage-tie
is in his hand.” Thereupon the young man went out, sore afflicted
and sadly vexed and, returning home, fell sick, for his heart had
received its death-blow; so he presently died. But as for Ala
al-Din, after receiving his goods he went to the bazar and buying
what meats and drinks he needed, made a banquet as usual against
the night, saying to Zubaydah, “See these lying Dervishes; they
promised us and broke their promises.” Quoth she, “Thou art the
son of a Consul of the merchants, yet was thy hand short of half
a dirham; how then should it be with poor Dervishes?” Quoth
he, “Almighty Allah hath enabled us to do without them; but if
they come to us never again will I open the door to them.” She
asked, “Why so, whenas their coming footsteps brought us good
<span class="pageno" id="Page_59">59</span>luck; and, moreover, they put an hundred dinars under the prayer-carpet
for us every night? Perforce must thou open the door to
them an they come.” So when day departed with its light and
in gloom came night, they lighted the wax candles and he said
to her, “Rise, Zubaydah, make us music;” and behold, at this
moment some one knocked at the door, and she said, “Go and
look who is at the door.” So he went down and opened it and
seeing the Dervishes, said, “Oh, fair welcome to the liars! Come
up.” Accordingly they went up with him and he seated them and
brought them the tray of food; and they ate and drank and
became merry and mirthful, and presently said to him, “O my
lord, our hearts have been troubled for thee: what hath passed
between thee and thy father-in-law?” He answered, “Allah compensated
us beyond and above our desire.” Rejoined they, “By
Allah, we were in fear for thee”——And Shahrazad perceived the
dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say.</p>

<div>

<div class="nf-center-c1">
<div class="nf-center c005">
    <div>Now when it was the Two Hundred and Fifty-ninth Night,</div>
  </div>
</div>

</div>

<p class="c000">She said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that the
Dervishes thus addressed Ala al-Din, “By Allah, we were in fear
for thee and naught kept us from thee but our lack of cash and
coin.” Quoth he, “Speedy relief hath come to me from my Lord;
for my father hath sent me fifty thousand dinars and fifty loads of
stuffs, each load worth a thousand dinars; besides a riding-mule, a
robe of sables, an Abyssinian slave and a basin and ewer of gold.
Moreover, I have made my peace with my father-in-law and my
wife hath become my lawful wife by my paying her settlement; so
laud to Allah for that!” Presently the Caliph rose to do a necessity;
whereupon Ja’afar bent him towards Ala al-Din and said,
“Look to thy manners, for thou art in the presence of the Commander
of the Faithful.” Asked he, “How have I failed in good
breeding before the Commander of the Faithful, and which of you
is he?” Quoth Ja’afar, “He who went out but now to make
water is the Commander of the Faithful, Harun al-Rashid, and I
am the Wazir Ja’afar; and this is Masrur the executioner and this
other is Abu Nowas Hasan bin Hani. And now, O Ala al-Din,
use thy reason and bethink thee how many days’ journey it is
between Cairo and Baghdad.” He replied, “Five-and-forty days’
journey;” and Ja’afar rejoined, “Thy baggage was stolen only ten
<span class="pageno" id="Page_60">60</span>days ago; so how could the news have reached thy father, and
how could he pack thee up other goods and send them to thee
five-and-forty days’ journey in ten days’ time?” Quoth Ala al-Din,
“O my lord and whence then came they?” “From the
Commander of the Faithful,” replied Ja’afar, “of his great affection
for thee.” As they were speaking, lo! the Caliph entered and
Ala al-Din rising, kissed the ground before him and said, “Allah
keep thee, O Prince of the Faithful, and give thee long life; and
may the lieges never lack thy bounty and beneficence!” Replied
the Caliph, “O Ala al-Din, let Zubaydah play us an air, by way of
house-warming<a id="r76"></a><a href="#f76" class="c014"><sup>[76]</sup></a> for thy deliverance.” Thereupon she played him on
the lute so rare a melody that the very stones shook for glee, and
the strings cried out for present ecstasy, “O Loving One!” They
spent the night after the merriest fashion, and in the morning the
Caliph said to Ala al-Din, “Come to the Divan to-morrow.” He
answered, “Hearkening and obedience, O Commander of the
Faithful; so Allah will and thou be well and in good case!” On
the morrow he took ten trays and, putting on each a costly present,
went up with them to the palace; and the Caliph was sitting on
the throne when, behold, Ala al-Din appeared at the door of the
Divan, repeating these two couplets:—</p>

<div class="lg-container-b c003">
  <div class="linegroup">
    <div class="group">
      <div class="line">Honour and Glory wait on thee each morn! ✿ Thine enviers’ noses in the dust be set!</div>
      <div class="line">Ne’er cease thy days to be as white as snow; ✿ Thy foeman’s days to be as black as jet!</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class="c000">“Welcome, O Ala al-Din!” said the Caliph, and he replied,
“O Commander of the Faithful, the Prophet (whom Allah bless
and assain!)<a id="r77"></a><a href="#f77" class="c014"><sup>[77]</sup></a> was wont to accept presents; and these ten trays,
with what is on them, are my offering to thee.” The Caliph
accepted his gift and, ordering him a robe of honour, made him
Provost of the merchants and gave him a seat in the Divan. And
as he was sitting behold, his father-in-law came in and, seeing
<span class="pageno" id="Page_61">61</span>Ala al-Din seated in his place and clad in a robe of honour, said
to the Caliph, “O King of the age, why is this man sitting in my
place and wearing this robe of honour?” Quoth the Caliph, “I
have made him Provost of the merchants, for offices are by investiture
and not in perpetuity, and thou art deposed.” Answered the
merchant, “Thou hast done well, O Commander of the Faithful,
for he is ours and one of us. Allah make the best of us the
managers of our affairs! How many a little one hath become
great!” Then the Caliph wrote Ala al-Din a Firman<a id="r78"></a><a href="#f78" class="c014"><sup>[78]</sup></a> of investiture
and gave it to the Governor who gave it to the crier,<a id="r79"></a><a href="#f79" class="c014"><sup>[79]</sup></a> and the
crier made proclamation in the Divan saying, “None is Provost of
the merchants but Ala al-Din Abu al-Shamat, and his word is to
be heard, and he must be obeyed with due respect paid, and he
meriteth homage and honour and high degree!” Moreover, when
the Divan broke up, the Governor went down with the crier before
Ala al-Din and the crier repeated the proclamation and they
carried Ala al-Din through the thoroughfares of Baghdad, making
proclamation of his dignity. Next day, Ala al-Din opened a shop
for his slave Salim and set him therein, to buy and sell, whilst he
himself rode to the palace and took his place in the Caliph’s
Divan.——And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased
saying her permitted say.</p>

<div>

<div class="nf-center-c1">
<div class="nf-center c005">
    <div>Now when it was the Two Hundred and Sixtieth Night,</div>
  </div>
</div>

</div>

<p class="c000">She said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that Ala al-Din
rode to the palace and took his place in the Caliph’s Divan. Now
it came to pass one day, when he sat in his stead as was his wont,
behold, one said to the Caliph, “O Commander of the Faithful,
may thy head survive such an one the cup-companion!; for he is
gone to the mercy of Almighty Allah, but be thy life prolonged!”<a id="r80"></a><a href="#f80" class="c014"><sup>[80]</sup></a>
Quoth the Caliph, “Where is Ala al-Din Abu al-Shamat?” So
he went up to the Commander of the Faithful, who at once clad
him in a splendid dress of honour and made him his boon-companion;
appointing him a monthly pay and allowance of a thousand
dinars. He continued to keep him company till, one day, as he
<span class="pageno" id="Page_62">62</span>sat in the Divan, according to his custom attending upon the Caliph,
lo and behold! an Emir came up with sword and shield in hand
and said, “O Commander of the Faithful, may thy head long outlive
the Head of the Sixty, for he is dead this day;” whereupon
the Caliph ordered Ala al-Din a dress of honour and made him
Chief of the Sixty, in place of the other who had neither wife nor
son nor daughter. So Ala al-Din laid hands on his estate and
the Caliph said to him, “Bury him in the earth and take all he hath
left of wealth and slaves and handmaids.”<a id="r81"></a><a href="#f81" class="c014"><sup>[81]</sup></a> Then he shook the
handkerchief<a id="r82"></a><a href="#f82" class="c014"><sup>[82]</sup></a> and dismissed the Divan, whereupon Ala al-Din went
forth, attended by Ahmad al-Danaf, captain of the right, and Hasan
Shúmán, captain of the left, riding at his either stirrup, each with
his forty men.<a id="r83"></a><a href="#f83" class="c014"><sup>[83]</sup></a> Presently, he turned to Hasan Shuman and his
men and said to them, “Plead ye for me with the Captain Ahmad
al-Danaf that he please to accept me as his son by covenant before
Allah.” And Ahmad assented, saying, “I and my forty men will
go before thee to the Divan every morning.” Now after this Ala
al-Din continued in the Caliph’s service many days; till one day
it chanced that he left the Divan and returning home, dismissed
Ahmad al-Danaf and his men and sat down with his wife Zubaydah,
the lute-player, who lighted the wax candles and went out of
the room upon an occasion. Suddenly he heard a loud shriek; so
he rose up and running in haste to see what was the matter, found
that it was his wife who had cried out. She was lying at full
length on the ground and, when he put his hand to her breast, he
found her dead. Now her father’s house faced that of Ala al-Din,
and he, hearing the shriek, came in and said, “What is the matter,
O my lord Ala al-Din?” He replied, “O my father, may thy
head outlive thy daughter Zubaydah! But, O my father, honour
to the dead is burying them.” So when the morning dawned,
they buried her in the earth and her husband and father condoled
with and mutually consoled each other. Thus far concerning her;
but as regards Ala al-Din, he donned mourning dress and declined
the Divan, abiding tearful-eyed and heavy-hearted at home. After
a while, the Caliph said to Ja’afar, “O Wazir, what is the cause of
<span class="pageno" id="Page_63">63</span>Ala al-Din’s absence from the Divan?” The Minister answered,
“O Commander of the Faithful, he is in mourning for his wife
Zubaydah; and is occupied in receiving those who come to console
him;” and the Caliph said, “It behoveth us to pay him a
visit of condolence.” “I hear and I obey,” replied Ja’afar. So
they took horse, the Caliph and the Minister and a few attendants,
and rode to Ala al-Din’s house and, as he was sitting at home,
behold, the party came in upon him; whereupon he rose to receive
them and kissed the ground before the Caliph, who said to him,
“Allah make good thy loss to thee!” Answered Ala al-Din,
“May Allah preserve thee to us, O Commander of the Faithful!”
Then said the Caliph, “O Ala al-Din, why hast thou absented
thyself from the Divan?” And he replied, “Because of my
mourning for my wife, Zubaydah, O Commander of the Faithful.”
The Caliph rejoined, “Put away grief from thee: verily she is
dead and gone to the mercy of Almighty Allah and mourning
will avail thee nothing; no, nothing.” But Ala al-Din said “O
Commander of the Faithful, I shall never leave mourning for her
till I die and they bury me by her side.” Quoth the Caliph, “In
Allah is compensation for every decease, and neither device nor
riches can deliver from death; and divinely gifted was he who
said:—</p>

<div class="lg-container-b c003">
  <div class="linegroup">
    <div class="group">

      <div class="line">How then shall ‘joy man joy or taste delight, ✿ Upon whose cheeks shall rest the dust and clay?”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class="c000">When the Caliph had made an end of condoling with him, he
charged him not to absent himself from the Divan and returned
to his palace. And Ala al-Din, after a last sorrowful night,
mounted early in the morning and, riding to the court, kissed the
ground before the Commander of the Faithful who made a movement
<span class="pageno" id="Page_64">64</span>as if rising from the throne,<a id="r85"></a><a href="#f85" class="c014"><sup>[85]</sup></a> to greet and welcome him; and
bade him take his appointed place in the Divan, saying, “O Ala
al-Din, thou art my guest to-night.” So presently he carried him
into his serraglio and calling a slave-girl named Kút al-Kulúb, said
to her, “Ala al-Din had a wife called Zubaydah, who used to sing
to him and solace him of cark and care; but she is gone to the
mercy of Almighty Allah, and now I would have thee play him
an air upon the lute,”——And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of
day and ceased saying her permitted say.</p>

<div>

<div class="nf-center-c1">
<div class="nf-center c005">
    <div>Now when it was the Two Hundred and Sixty-first Night,</div>
  </div>
</div>

</div>

<p class="c000">She said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that the Caliph
said to the damsel Kut al-Kulub, “I would have thee play him
upon the lute an air, of fashion sweet and rare, that he may be
solaced of his cark and care.” So she rose and made sweet music;
and the Caliph said to Ala al-Din, “What sayst thou of this
damsel’s voice?” He replied, “Verily, O Commander of the
Faithful, Zubaydah’s voice was the finer; but she is skilled in
touching the lute cunningly and her playing would make a rock
dance with glee.” The Caliph asked, “Doth she please thee?”
and he answered, “She doth, O Commander of the Faithful;”
whereupon the King said, “By the life of my head and the tombs
of my forefathers, she is a gift from me to thee, she and her
waiting-women!” Ala al-Din fancied that the Caliph was jesting
with him; but, on the morrow, the King went in to Kut
al-Kulub and said to her, “I have given thee to Ala al-Din;”
whereat she rejoiced, for she had seen and loved him. Then the
Caliph returned from his serraglio-palace to the Divan; and,
calling porters, said to them, “Set all the goods of Kut al-Kulub
and her waiting-women in a litter, and carry them to Ala al-Din’s
home.” So they conducted her to the house and showed her into
the pavilion, whilst the Caliph sat in the hall of audience till the
close of day, when the Divan broke up and he retired to his
harem. Such was his case; but as regards Kut al-Kulub, when
she had taken up her lodging in Ala al-Din’s mansion, she and
her women, forty in all, besides the eunuchry, she called two of
these caponised slaves and said to them, “Sit ye on stools, one on
<span class="pageno" id="Page_65">65</span>the right and another on the left hand of the door; and, when
Ala al-Din cometh home, both of you kiss his hands and say to
him, “Our mistress Kut al-Kulub requesteth thy presence in the
pavilion, for the Caliph hath given her to thee, her and her
women.”” They answered, “We hear and obey;” and did as she
bade them. So, when Ala al-Din returned, he found two of the
Caliph’s eunuchs sitting at the door and was amazed at the matter
and said to himself, “Surely, this is not my own house; or else
what can have happened?” Now when the eunuchs saw him,
they rose to him and, kissing his hands, said to him, “We are of
the Caliph’s household and slaves to Kut al-Kulub, who saluteth
thee giving thee to know that the Caliph hath bestowed her on
thee, her and her women, and requesteth thy presence.” Quoth
Ala al-Din, “Say ye to her:—Thou art welcome; but so long as
thou shalt abide with me, I will not enter the pavilion wherein
thou art, for what was the master’s should not become the man’s;
and furthermore ask her:—What was the sum of thy day’s expenditure
in the Caliph’s palace?” So they went in and did his
errand to her, and she answered, “An hundred dinars a day;”
whereupon quoth he to himself, “There was no need for the Caliph
to give me Kut al-Kulub, that I should be put to such expense for
her; but there is no help for it.” So she abode with him awhile
and he assigned her daily an hundred dinars for her maintenance;
till, one day, he absented himself from the Divan and the Caliph
said to Ja’afar, “O Wazir, I gave not Kut al-Kulub unto Ala
al-Din but that she might console him for his wife; why, then,
doth he still hold aloof from us?” Answered Ja’afar, “O Commander
of the Faithful, he spake sooth who said:—Whoso findeth
his fere, forgetteth his friends.” Rejoined the Caliph, “Haply he
hath not absented himself without excuse, but we will pay him
a visit.” Now some days before this, Ala al-Din had said to
Ja’afar, “I complained to the Caliph of my grief and mourning for
the loss of my wife Zubaydah and he gave me Kut al-Kulub;”
and the Minister replied, “Except he loved thee, he had not given
her to thee. Say hast thou gone in unto her, O Ala al-Din?”
He rejoined, “No, by Allah! I know not her length from her
breadth.” He asked “And why?” and he answered, “O Wazir,
what befitteth the lord befitteth not the liege.” Then the Caliph
and Ja’afar disguised themselves and went privily to visit Ala
al-Din; but he knew them and rising to them kissed the hands
of the Caliph, who looked at him and saw signs of sorrow in
<span class="pageno" id="Page_66">66</span>his face. So he said to him, “O Ala al-Din, whence cometh
this sorrow wherein I see thee? Hast thou not gone in unto
Kut al-Kulub?” He replied, “O Commander of the Faithful,
what befitteth the lord befitteth not the thrall. No, as yet I
have not gone in to visit her nor do I know her length from her
breadth; so pray quit me of her.” Quoth the Caliph, “I would
fain see her and question her of her case;” and quoth Ala al-Din,
“I hear and I obey, O Commander of the Faithful.” So the
Caliph went in——And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day
and ceased to say her permitted say.</p>

<div>

<div class="nf-center-c1">
<div class="nf-center c005">
    <div>Now when it was the Two Hundred and Sixty-second Night,</div>
  </div>
</div>

</div>

<p class="c000">She said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that the Caliph
went in to Kut al-Kulub, who rose to him on sighting him and
kissed the ground between his hands; when he said to her, “Hath
Ala al-Din gone in unto thee?” and she answered, “No, O Commander
of the Faithful, I sent to bid him come, but he would not.”
So the Caliph bade carry her back to the Harim and saying to
Ala al-Din, “Do not absent thyself from us,” returned to his
palace. Accordingly, next morning, Ala al-Din mounted and
rode to the Divan, where he took his seat as Chief of the Sixty.
Presently the Caliph ordered his treasurer to give the Wazir
Ja’afar ten thousand dinars and said when his order was obeyed,
“I charge thee to go down to the bazar where handmaidens are
sold and buy Ala al-Din a slave-girl with this sum.” So in
obedience to the King Ja’afar took Ala al-Din and went down
with him to the bazar. Now as chance would have it, that very
day, the Emir Khálid, whom the Caliph had made Governor of
Baghdad, went down to the market to buy a slave-girl for his son
and the cause of his going was that his wife, Khátún by name, had
borne him a son called Habzalam Bazázah,<a id="r86"></a><a href="#f86" class="c014"><sup>[86]</sup></a> and the same was
foul of favour and had reached the age of twenty, without learning
to mount horse; albeit his father was brave and bold, a doughty
<span class="pageno" id="Page_67">67</span>rider ready to plunge into the Sea of Darkness.<a id="r87"></a><a href="#f87" class="c014"><sup>[87]</sup></a> And it happened
that on a certain night he had a dream which caused nocturnal
pollution, whereof he told his mother who rejoiced and said to his
father, “I want to find him a wife, as he is now ripe for wedlock.”
Quoth Khalid, “The fellow is so foul of favour and withal so rank
of odour, so sordid and beastly that no woman would take him
at a gift.” And she answered, “We will buy him a slave-girl.”
So it befel, for the accomplishing of what Allah Almighty had
decreed, that on the same day Ja’afar and Ala al-Din, the Governor
Khalid and his son went down to the market and behold,
they saw in the hands of a broker, a beautiful girl lovely-faced and
of perfect shape, and the Wazir said to him, “O broker, ask her
owner if he will take a thousand dinars for her.” And as the
broker passed by the Governor with the slave, Habzalam Bazazah
cast at her one glance of the eyes which entailed for himself one
thousand sighs; and he fell in love with her and passion got hold
of him and he said, “O my father, buy me yonder slave-girl.” So
the Emir called the broker, who brought the girl to him, and
asked her her name. She replied, “My name is Jessamine;” and
he said to Habzalam Bazazah, “O my son, an she please thee, do
thou bid higher for her.” Then he asked the broker, “What hath
been bidden for her?” and he replied, “A thousand dinars.” Said
the Governor’s son, “She is mine for a thousand pieces of gold and
one more;” and the broker passed on to Ala al-Din who bid two
thousand dinars for her; and as often as the Emir’s son bid
another dinar, Ala al-Din bid a thousand. The ugly youth was
vexed at this and said, “O broker! who is it that outbiddeth me
for the slave-girl?” Answered the broker, “It is the Wazir Ja’afar
who is minded to buy her for Ala al-Din Abu al-Shamat.” And
Ala al-Din continued till he brought her price up to ten thousand
dinars, and her owner was satisfied to sell her for that sum. Then
he took the girl and said to her, “I give thee thy freedom for the
love of Almighty Allah;” and forthwith wrote his contract of
marriage with her and carried her to his house. Now when the
broker returned, after having received his brokerage, the Emir’s
son summoned him and said to him, “Where is the girl?” Quoth
he, “She was bought for ten thousand dinars by Ala al-Din, who
hath set her free and married her.” At this the young man was
<span class="pageno" id="Page_68">68</span>greatly vexed and cast down and, sighing many a sigh, returned
home, sick for love of the damsel; and he threw himself on his bed
and refused food, for love and longing were sore upon him. Now
when his mother saw him in this plight, she said to him, “Heaven
assain thee, O my son! What aileth thee?” And he answered,
“Buy me Jessamine, O my mother.” Quoth she, “When the
flower-seller passeth I will buy thee a basketful of jessamine.”
Quoth he, “It is not the jessamine one smells, but a slave-girl
‘named Jessamine, whom my father would not buy for me.” So
she said to her husband, “Why and wherefore didst thou not buy
him the girl?” and he replied, “What is fit for the lord is not fit
for the liege and I have no power to take her: no less a man
bought her than Ala al-Din, Chief of the Sixty.” Then the
youth’s weakness redoubled upon him, till he gave up sleeping
and eating, and his mother bound her head with the fillets of
mourning. And while in her sadness she sat at home, lamenting
over her son, behold, came in to her an old woman, known as the
mother of Ahmad Kamákim<a id="r88"></a><a href="#f88" class="c014"><sup>[88]</sup></a> the arch-thief, a knave who would
bore through a middle wall and scale the tallest of the tall and
steal the very kohl off the eye-ball.<a id="r89"></a><a href="#f89" class="c014"><sup>[89]</sup></a> From his earliest years he
had been given to these malpractices, till they made him Captain
of the Watch, when he stole a sum of money; and the Chief of
Police, coming upon him in the act, carried him to the Caliph, who
bade put him to death on the common execution-ground.<a id="r90"></a><a href="#f90" class="c014"><sup>[90]</sup></a> But he
implored protection of the Wazir whose intercession the Caliph
never rejected; so he pleaded for him with the Commander of the
Faithful who said, “How canst thou intercede for this pest of the
human race?” Ja’afar answered, “O Commander of the Faithful,
do thou imprison him; whoso built the first jail was a sage, seeing
that a jail is the grave of the living and a joy for the foe.” So the
Caliph bade lay him in bilboes and write thereon, “Appointed to
remain here until death and not to be loosed but on the corpse-washer’s
bench;” and they cast him fettered into limbo. Now his
mother was a frequent visitor to the house of the Emir Khalid,
who was Governor and Chief of Police; and she used to go in to
her son in jail and say to him, “Did I not warn thee to turn from
<span class="pageno" id="Page_69">69</span>thy wicked ways?”<a id="r91"></a><a href="#f91" class="c014"><sup>[91]</sup></a> And he would always answer her, “Allah
decreed this to me; but, O my mother, when thou visitest the
Emir’s wife make her intercede for me with her husband.” So
when the old woman came into the Lady Khatun, she found her
bound with the fillets of mourning and said to her, “Wherefore
dost thou mourn?” She replied, “For my son Habzalam Bazazah;”
and the old woman exclaimed, “Heaven assain thy son!; what
hath befallen him?” So the mother told her the whole story,
and she said, “What wouldst thou say of him who should achieve
such a feat as would save thy son?” Asked the lady, “And what
feat wilt thou do?” Quoth the old woman, “I have a son called
Ahmad Kamakim, the arch-thief, who lieth chained in jail and on
his bilboes is written:—Appointed to remain till death; so do
thou don thy richest clothes and trick thee out with thy finest
jewels and present thyself to thy husband with an open face and
smiling mien; and when he seeketh of thee what men seek of
women, put him off and baulk him of his will and say:—By Allah,
‘tis a strange thing! When a man desireth aught of his wife he
dunneth her till she doeth it; but if a wife desire aught of her
husband, he will not grant it to her. Then he will say:—What
dost thou want?; and do thou answer:—First swear to grant my
request. If he swear to thee by his head or by Allah, say to him:—Swear
to me the oath of divorce, and do not yield to him,
except he do this. And whenas he hath sworn to thee the oath
of divorce, say to him:—Thou keepest in prison a man called
Ahmad Kamakim, and he hath a poor old mother, who hath set
upon me and who urgeth me in the matter and who saith, Let
thy husband intercede for him with the Caliph, that my son may
repent and thou gain heavenly guerdon.” And the Lady Khatun
replied, “I hear and obey.” So when her husband came into her——And
Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying
her permitted say.</p>

</div>

<p class="c000">She said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that the
Governor came in to his wife, who spoke to him as she had been
<span class="pageno" id="Page_70">70</span>taught and made him swear the divorce-oath before she would
yield to his wishes. He lay with her that night and, when morning
dawned, after he had made the Ghusl-ablution and prayed the
dawn-prayer, he repaired to the prison and said, “O Ahmad
Kamakim, O thou arch-thief, dost thou repent of thy works?”;
whereto he replied, “I do indeed repent and turn to Allah and
say with heart and tongue:—I ask pardon of Allah.” So the
Governor took him out of jail and carried him to the Court (he
being still in bilboes) and, approaching the Caliph kissed ground
before him. Quoth the King, “O Emir Khalid, what seekest
thou?”; whereupon he brought forward Ahmad Kamakim,
shuffling and tripping in his fetters, and the Caliph said to him,
“What! art thou yet alive, O Kamakim?” He replied, “O
Commander of the Faithful, the miserable are long-lived.” Quoth
the Caliph to the Emir, “Why hast thou brought him hither?”;
and quoth he, “O Commander of the Faithful, he hath a poor old
mother cut off from the world who hath none but this son and she
hath had recourse to thy slave, imploring him to intercede with
thee to strike off his chains, for he repenteth of his evil courses;
and to make him Captain of the Watch as before.” The Caliph
asked Ahmad Kamakim, “Dost thou repent of thy sins?” “I
do indeed repent me to Allah, O Commander of the Faithful,”
answered he; whereupon the Caliph called for the blacksmith and
made him strike off his irons on the corpse-washer’s bench.<a id="r92"></a><a href="#f92" class="c014"><sup>[92]</sup></a>
Moreover, he restored him to his former office and charged him
to walk in the ways of godliness and righteousness. So he kissed
the Caliph’s hands and, being invested with the uniform of Captain
of the Watch, he went forth, whilst they made proclamation of his
appointment. Now for a long time he abode in the exercise of
his office, till one day his mother went in to the Governor’s wife,
who said to her, “Praised be Allah who hath delivered thy son
from prison and restored him to health and safety! But why dost
thou not bid him contrive some trick to get the girl Jessamine
for son Habzalam Bazazah?” “That will I,” answered she and,
going out from her, repaired to her son. She found him drunk
with wine and said to him, “O my son, no one caused thy release
from jail but the wife of the Governor, and she would have thee
find some means to slay Ala al-Din Abu al-Shamat and get his
slave-girl Jessamine for her son Habzalam Bazazah.” He answered,
<span class="pageno" id="Page_71">71</span>“That will be the easiest of things; and I must needs set about it
this very night.” Now this was the first night of the new month,
and it was the custom of the Caliph to spend that night with the
Lady Zubaydah, for the setting free of a slave-girl or a Mameluke
or something of the sort. Moreover, on such occasions he used to
doff his royal habit, together with his rosary and dagger-sword and
royal signet, and set them all upon a chair in the sitting-saloon:
and he had also a golden lanthorn, adorned with three jewels
strung on a wire of gold, by which he set great store; and he
would commit all these things to the charge of the eunuchry,
whilst he went into the Lady Zubaydah’s apartment. So arch-thief
Ahmad Kamakim waited till midnight, when Canopus shone
bright, and all creatures to sleep were dight whilst the Creator
veiled them with the veil of night. Then he took his drawn sword
in his right and his grappling-hook in his left and, repairing to
the Caliph’s sitting-saloon planted his scaling ladder and cast his
grapnel on to the side of the terrace-roof; then, raising the trap-door,
let himself down into the saloon, where he found the eunuchs asleep.
He drugged them with hemp-fumes;<a id="r93"></a><a href="#f93" class="c014"><sup>[93]</sup></a> and, taking the Caliph’s dress,
dagger, rosary, kerchief, signet-ring and the lanthorn whereupon
were the pearls, returned whence he came and betook himself to
the house of Ala al-Din, who had that night celebrated his wedding
festivities with Jessamine and had gone in unto her and gotten
her with child. So arch-thief Ahmad Kamakim climbed over into
his saloon and, raising one of the marble slabs from the sunken part
of the floor,<a id="r94"></a><a href="#f94" class="c014"><sup>[94]</sup></a> dug a hole under it and laid the stolen things therein,
all save the lanthorn, which he kept for himself. Then he plastered
down the marble slab as it before was, and returning whence he
came, went back to his own house, saying, “I will now tackle my
drink and set this lanthorn before me and quaff the cup to its
light.”<a id="r95"></a><a href="#f95" class="c014"><sup>[95]</sup></a> Now as soon as it was dawn of day, the Caliph went out
into the sitting-chamber; and, seeing the eunuchs drugged with
hemp, aroused them. Then he put his hand to the chair and
found neither dress nor signet nor rosary nor dagger-sword nor
<span class="pageno" id="Page_72">72</span>kerchief nor lanthorn; whereat he was exceeding wroth and
donning the dress of anger, which was a scarlet suit,<a id="r96"></a><a href="#f96" class="c014"><sup>[96]</sup></a> sat down in
the Divan. So the Wazir Ja’afar came forward and kissing the
ground before him, said, “Allah avert all evil from the Commander
of the Faithful!” Answered the Caliph, “O Wazir, the evil is
passing great!” Ja’afar asked, “What has happened?” so he told
him what had occurred; and, behold, the Chief of Police appeared
with Ahmad Kamakim the robber at his stirrup, when he found
the Commander of the Faithful sore enraged. As soon as the
Caliph saw him, he said to him, “O Emir Khalid, how goes
Baghdad?” And he answered, “Safe and secure.” Cried he,
“Thou liest!” “How so, O Prince of True Believers?” asked
the Emir. So he told him the case and added, “I charge thee
to bring me back all the stolen things.” Replied the Emir, “O
Commander of the Faithful, the vinegar worm is of and in the
vinegar, and no stranger can get at this place.”<a id="r97"></a><a href="#f97" class="c014"><sup>[97]</sup></a> But the Caliph
said, “Except thou bring me these things, I will put thee to
death.” Quoth he, “Ere thou slay me, slay Ahmad Kamakim,
for none should know the robber and the traitor but the Captain
of the Watch.” Then came forward Ahmad Kamakim and said
to the Caliph, “Accept my intercession for the Chief of Police, and
I will be responsible to thee for the thief and will track his trail
till I find him; but give me two Kazis and two Assessors for he
who did this thing feareth thee not, nor doth he fear the Governor
nor any other.” Answered the Caliph, “Thou shalt have what
thou wantest; but let search be made first in my palace and then
in those of the Wazir and the Chief of the Sixty.” Rejoined
Ahmad Kamakim, “Thou sayest well, O Commander of the Faithful;
belike the man that did this ill-deed be one who hath been
reared in the King’s houshold or in that of one of his officers.”
Cried the Caliph, “As my head liveth, whosoever shall have done
<span class="pageno" id="Page_73">73</span>the deed I will assuredly put him to death, be it mine own son!”
Then Ahmad Kamakim received a written warrant to enter and
perforce search the houses;——And Shahrazad perceived the
dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say.</p>

<div>

<div class="nf-center-c1">
<div class="nf-center c005">
    <div>Now when it was the Two Hundred and Sixty-fourth Night,</div>
  </div>
</div>

</div>

<p class="c000">She said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that Ahmad
Kamakim got what he wanted, and received a written warrant to
enter and perforce search the houses; so he fared forth, taking
in his hand a rod<a id="r98"></a><a href="#f98" class="c014"><sup>[98]</sup></a> made of bronze and copper, iron and steel, of
each three equal parts. He first searched the palace of the Caliph,
then that of the Wazir Ja’afar; after which he went the round of
the houses of the Chamberlains and the Viceroys till he came to
that of Ala al-Din. Now when the Chief of the Sixty heard the
clamour before his house, he left his wife Jessamine and went down
and, opening the door, found the Master of Police without in the
midst of a tumultuous crowd. So he said, “What is the matter, O
Emir Khalid?” Thereupon the Chief told him the case and Ala
al-Din said, “Enter my house and search it.” The Governor
replied, “Pardon, O my lord; thou art a man in whom trust is
reposed and Allah forfend that the trusty turn traitor!” Quoth
Ala al-Din, “There is no help for it but that my house be
searched.” So the Chief of Police entered, attended by the Kazi
and his Assessors; whereupon Ahmad Kamakim went straight to
the depressed floor of the saloon and came to the slab, under
which he had buried the stolen goods and let the rod fall upon it
with such violence that the marble broke in sunder and behold
something glittered underneath. Then said he, “Bismillah; in the
name of Allah! Mashallah; whatso Allah willeth! By the blessing
of our coming a hoard hath been hit upon; wait while we go
down into this hiding-place and see what is therein.” So the
Kazi and Assessors looked into the hole and finding there the
stolen goods, drew up a statement<a id="r99"></a><a href="#f99" class="c014"><sup>[99]</sup></a> of how they had discovered
them in Ala al-Din’s house, to which they set their seals. Then,
they bade seize upon Ala al-Din and took his turband from his
<span class="pageno" id="Page_74">74</span>head, and officially registered all his monies and effects which
were in the mansion. Meanwhile, arch-thief Ahmad Kamakim
laid hands on Jessamine, who was with child by Ala al-Din, and
committed her to his mother, saying, “Deliver her to Khatun, the
Governor’s lady:” so the old woman took her and carried her
to the wife of the Master of Police. Now as soon as Habzalam
Bazazah saw her, health and heart returned to him and he arose
without stay or delay and joyed with exceeding joy and would
have drawn near her; but she pluckt a dagger from her girdle
and said, “Keep off from me, or I will kill thee and kill myself
after.” Exclaimed his mother, “O strumpet, let my son have his
will of thee!” But Jessamine answered “O bitch, by what law is
it lawful for a woman to marry two men; and how shall the dog
be admitted to the place of the lion?” With this, the ugly youth’s
love-longing redoubled and he sickened for yearning and unfulfilled
desire; and refusing food returned to his pillow. Then said
his mother to her, “O harlot, how canst thou make me thus to
sorrow for my son? Needs must I punish thee with torture; and
as for Ala al-Din, he will assuredly be hanged.” “And I will die
for love of him,” answered Jessamine. Then the Governor’s wife
arose and stripped her of her jewels and silken raiment and,
clothing her in petticoat-trousers of sack-cloth and a shift of
hair-cloth, sent her down into the kitchen and made her a scullery-wench,
saying, “The reward for thy constancy shall be to break up
fire-wood and peel onions and set fire under the cooking-pots.”
Quoth she, “I am willing to suffer all manner of hardships and
servitude, but I will not suffer the sight of thy son.” However,
Allah inclined the hearts of the slave-girls to her and they used
to do her service in the kitchen. Such was the case with Jessamine;
but as regards Ala al-Din they carried him, together with
the stolen goods, to the Divan where the Caliph still sat upon his
throne. And behold, the King looked upon his effects and said,
“Where did ye find them?” They replied, “In the very middle
of the house belonging to Ala al-Din Abu al-Shamat;” whereat
the Caliph was filled with wrath and took the things, but found
not the lanthorn among them and said, “O Ala al-Din, where is
the lanthorn?” He answered “I stole it not; I know naught of
it; I never saw it; I can give no information about it!” Said the
Caliph, “O traitor, how cometh it that I brought thee near unto
me and thou hast cast me out afar, and I trusted in thee and thou
betrayest me?” And he commanded to hang him. So the Chief
<span class="pageno" id="Page_75">75</span>of Police took him and went down with him into the city, whilst
the crier preceded them proclaiming aloud and saying, “This is
the reward and the least of the reward he shall receive who doth
treason against the Caliphs of True Belief!” And the folk
flocked to the place where the gallows stood. Thus far concerning
him; but as regards Ahmad al-Danaf, Ala al-Din’s adopted
father, he was sitting making merry with his followers in a
garden, and carousing and pleasuring when lo! in came one of
the water-carriers of the Divan and, kissing the hand of Ahmad
al-Danaf, said to him, “O Captain Ahmad, O Danaf! thou sittest
at thine ease with water flowing at thy feet,<a id="r100"></a><a href="#f100" class="c014"><sup>[100]</sup></a> and thou knowest
not what hath happened.” Asked Ahmad, “What is it?” and
the other answered, “They have gone down to the gallows with
thy son Ala al-Din, adopted by a covenant before Allah!”
Quoth Ahmad, “What is the remedy here, O Hasan Shuuman,
and what sayst thou of this?” He replied, “Assuredly Ala al-Din
is innocent and this blame hath come to him from some one
enemy.”<a id="r101"></a><a href="#f101" class="c014"><sup>[101]</sup></a> Quoth Ahmad, “What counsellest thou?” and Hasan
said, “We must rescue him, Inshallah!” Then he went to the jail
and said to the gaolor, “Give us some one who deserveth death.”
So he gave him one that was likest of men to Ala al-Din Abu al-Shamat;
and they covered his head and carried him to the place
of execution between Ahmad al-Danaf and Ali al-Zaybak of
Cairo.<a id="r102"></a><a href="#f102" class="c014"><sup>[102]</sup></a> Now they had brought Ala al-Din to the gibbet, to hang
him, but Ahmad al-Danaf came forward and set his foot on that
of the hangman, who said, “Give me room to do my duty.”
He replied, “O accursed, take this man and hang him in Ala al-Din’s
stead; for he is innocent and we will ransom him with
this fellow, even as Abraham ransomed Ishmael with the ram.”<a id="r103"></a><a href="#f103" class="c014"><sup>[103]</sup></a>
So the hangman seized the man and hanged him in lieu of Ala
al-Din; whereupon Ahmad and Ali took Ala al-Din and carried
<span class="pageno" id="Page_76">76</span>him to Ahmad’s quarters and, when there, Ala al-Din turned to
him and said, “O my sire and chief, Allah requite thee with
the best of good!” Quoth he, “O Ala al-Din”——And Shahrazad
perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted
say.</p>

    <div>Now when it was the Two Hundred and Sixty-fifth Night,</div>
  </div>
</div>

</div>

<p class="c000">She said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that Calamity
Ahmad cried, “O Ala al-Din, what is this deed thou hast done?
The mercy of Allah be on him who said:—Whoso trusteth thee
betray him not, e’en if thou be a traitor. Now the Caliph set
thee in high place about him and styled thee ‘Trusty’ and ‘Faithful’;
how then couldst thou deal thus with him and steal his
goods?” “By the Most Great Name, O my father and chief,”
replied Ala al-Din, “I had no hand in this, nor did I such deed,
nor know I who did it.” Quoth Ahmad, “Of a surety none
did this but a manifest enemy and whoso doth aught shall be
requited for his deed; but, O Ala al-Din, thou canst sojourn no
longer in Baghdad, for Kings, O my son, may not pass from one
thing to another, and when they go in quest of a man, ah! longsome
is his travail.” “Whither shall I go, O my chief?” asked
Ala al-Din; and he answered, “O my son, I will bring thee to
Alexandria, for it is a blessed place; its threshold is green and its
sojourn is agreeable.” And Ala al-Din rejoined, “I hear and I
obey, O my chief.” So Ahmad said to Hasan Shuuman, “Be
mindful and, when the Caliph asketh for me, say:—He is gone
touring about the provinces.” Then, taking Ala al-Din, he went
forth of Baghdad and stayed not going till they came to the outlying
vineyards and gardens, where they met two Jews of the
Caliph’s tax-gatherers, riding on mules. Quoth Ahmad Al-Danaf
to these, “Give me the black-mail;”<a id="r104"></a><a href="#f104" class="c014"><sup>[104]</sup></a> and quoth they, “Why
should we pay thee black-mail?” whereto he replied, “Because I
am the watchman of this valley.” So they gave him each an
hundred gold pieces, after which he slew them and took their
mules, one of which he mounted, whilst Ala al-Din bestrode the
other. Then they rode on till they came to the city of Ayás<a id="r105"></a><a href="#f105" class="c014"><sup>[105]</sup></a> and
<span class="pageno" id="Page_77">77</span>put up their beasts for the night at the Khan. And when morning
dawned, Ala al-Din sold his own mule and committed that of
Ahmad to the charge of the doorkeeper of the caravanserai, after
which they took ship from Ayas port and sailed to Alexandria.
Here they landed and walked up to the bazar and behold, there
was a broker crying a shop and a chamber behind it for nine
hundred and fifty dinars. Upon this Ala al-Din bid a thousand
which the broker accepted, for the premises belonged to the
Treasury; and the seller handed over to him the keys and the
buyer opened the shop and found the inner parlour furnished with
carpets and cushions. Moreover, he found there a store-room full
of sails and masts, cordage and seamen’s chests, bags of beads and
cowrie<a id="r106"></a><a href="#f106" class="c014"><sup>[106]</sup></a>-shells, stirrups, battle-axes, maces, knives, scissors and
such matters, for the last owner of the shop had been a dealer in
second-hand goods.<a id="r107"></a><a href="#f107" class="c014"><sup>[107]</sup></a> So he took his seat in the shop and Ahmad
al-Danaf said to him, “O my son, the shop and the room and that
which is therein are become thine; so tarry thou here and buy and
sell; and repine not at thy lot for Almighty Allah blesseth trade.”
After this he abode with him three days and on the fourth he took
leave of him, saying, “Abide here till I go back and bring thee the
Caliph’s pardon and learn who hath played thee this trick.” Then
he shipped for Ayas, where he took the mule from the inn and,
returning to Baghdad met Pestilence Hasan and his followers,
to whom said he, “Hath the Caliph asked after me?”; and he
replied, “No, nor hast thou come to his thought.” So he resumed
his service about the Caliph’s person and set himself to sniff about
for news of Ala al-Din’s case, till one day he heard the Caliph say
to the Wazir, “See, O Ja’afar, how Ala al-Din dealt with me!”
Replied the Minister, “O Commander of the Faithful, thou hast
requited him with hanging and hath he not met with his reward?”
Quoth he, “O Wazir, I have a mind to go down and see him
hanging;” and the Wazir answered, “Do what thou wilt, O Commander
of the Faithful.” So the Caliph, accompanied by Ja’afar,
went down to the place of execution and, raising his eyes, saw
the hanged man to be other than Ala al-Din Abu al-Shamat, surnamed
the Trusty, and said, “O Wazir, this is not Ala al-Din!”
“How knowest thou that it is not he?” asked the Minister, and the
<span class="pageno" id="Page_78">78</span>Caliph answered, “Ala al-Din was short and this one is tall.”
Quoth Ja’afar, “Hanging stretcheth.” Quoth the Caliph, “Ala
al-Din was fair and this one’s face is black.” Said Ja’afar,
“Knowest thou not, O Commander of the Faithful, that death is
followed by blackness?” Then the Caliph bade take down the
body from the gallows-tree and they found the names of the two
Shaykhs, Abu Bakr and Omar, written on its heels;<a id="r108"></a><a href="#f108" class="c014"><sup>[108]</sup></a> whereupon
cried the Caliph, “O Wazir, Ala al-Din was a Sunnite, and this
fellow is a Rejecter, a Shi’ah.” He answered, “Glory be to Allah
who knoweth the hidden things, while we know not whether this
was Ala al-Din or other than he.” Then the Caliph bade bury the
body and they buried it; and Ala al-Din was forgotten as though
he never had been. Such was his case; but as regards Habzalam
Bazazah, the Emir Khalid’s son, he ceased not to languish for love
and longing till he died and they joined him to the dust. And as
for the young wife Jessamine, she accomplished the months of her
pregnancy and, being taken with labour-pains, gave birth to a boy-child
like unto the moon. And when her fellow slave-girls said to
her, “What wilt thou name him?” she answered, “Were his father
well he had named him; but now I will name him Aslán.”<a id="r109"></a><a href="#f109" class="c014"><sup>[109]</sup></a> She
gave him suck for two successive years, then weaned him, and he
crawled and walked. Now it so came to pass that one day, whilst
his mother was busied with the service of the kitchen, the boy
went out and, seeing the stairs, mounted to the guest-chamber.<a id="r110"></a><a href="#f110" class="c014"><sup>[110]</sup></a>
And the Emir Khalid who was sitting there took him upon his lap
and glorified his Lord for that which he had created and fashioned;
then closely eyeing his face, the Governor saw that he was the
likest of all creatures to Ala al-Din Abu al-Shamat. Presently,
his mother Jessamine sought for him and finding him not,
mounted to the guest-chamber, where she saw the Emir seated,
with the child playing in his lap, for Allah had inclined his heart to
the boy. And when the child espied his mother, he would have
thrown himself upon her; but the Emir held him tight to his
bosom and said to Jessamine, “Come hither, O damsel.” So she
<span class="pageno" id="Page_79">79</span>came to him, when he said to her, “Whose son is this?”; and she
replied, “He is my son and the fruit of my vitals.” “And who is
his father?” asked the Emir; and she answered, “His father was
Ala al-Din Abu al-Shamat, but now he is become thy son.”
Quoth Khalid, “In very sooth Ala al-Din was a traitor.” Quoth
she, “Allah deliver him from treason! the Heavens forfend and
forbid that the ‘Trusty’ should be a traitor!” Then said he,
“When this boy shall grow up and reach man’s estate and say
to thee:—Who is my father? say to him:—Thou art the son of
the Emir Khalid, Governor and Chief of Police.” And she
answered, “I hear and I obey.” Then he circumcised the boy
and reared him with the goodliest rearing, and engaged for him
a professor of law and religious science, and an expert pensman
who taught him to read and write; so he read the Koran twice
and learnt it by heart and he grew up, saying to the Emir, “O my
father!” Moreover, the Governor used to go down with him to
the tilting-ground and assemble horsemen and teach the lad the
fashion of fight and fray, and the place to plant lance-thrust and
sabre-stroke; so that by the time he was fourteen years old, he
became a valiant wight and accomplished knight and gained the
rank of Emir. Now it chanced one day that Aslan fell in with
Ahmad Kamakim, the arch-thief, and accompanied him as cup-companion
to the tavern<a id="r111"></a><a href="#f111" class="c014"><sup>[111]</sup></a> and behold, Ahmad took out the
jewelled lanthorn he had stolen from the Caliph and, setting it
before him, pledged the wine cup to its light, till he became
drunken. So Aslan said to him, “O Captain, give me this lanthorn;”
but he replied, “I cannot give it to thee.” Asked Aslan,
“Why not?”; and Ahmad answered, “Because lives have been
lost for it.” “Whose life?” enquired Aslan; and Ahmad rejoined,
“There came hither a man who was made Chief of the Sixty;
he was named Ala al-Din Abu al-Shamat and he lost his life
through this lanthorn.” Quoth Aslan, “And what was that story,
and what brought about his death?” Quoth Ahmad Kamakim,
“Thou hadst an elder brother by name Habzalam Bazazah, and
when he reached the age of sixteen and was ripe for marriage,
thy father would have bought him a slave-girl named Jessamine.”
And he went on to tell him the whole story from first to last of
<span class="pageno" id="Page_80">80</span>Habzalam Bazazah’s illness and what befel Ala al-Din in his
innocence. When Aslan heard this, he said in thought, “Haply
this slave-girl was my mother Jessamine, and my father was none
other than Ala al-Din Abu al-Shamat.” So the boy went out
from him sorrowful, and met Calamity Ahmad, who at sight of
him exclaimed, “Glory be to Him unto whom none is like!”
Asked Hasan the Pestilence, “Whereat dost thou marvel, O my
chief?” and Ahmad the Calamity replied, “At the make of yonder
boy Aslan, for he is the likest of human creatures to Ala al-Din
Abu al Shamat.” Then he called the lad and said to him, “O
Aslan what is thy mother’s name?”; to which he replied, “She is
called the damsel Jessamine;” and the other said, “Harkye,
Aslan, be of good cheer and keep thine eyes cool and clear; for
thy father was none other than Ala al-Din Abu al-Shamat: but,
O my son, go thou in to thy mother and question her of thy
father.” He said, “Hearkening and obedience,” and, going in to
his mother put the question; whereupon quoth she, “Thy sire is
the Emir Khalid!” “Not so,” rejoined he, “my father was none
other than Ala al-Din Abu al-Shamat.” At this the mother wept
and said, “Who acquainted thee with this, O my son?” And he
answered “Ahmad Al-Danaf, Captain of the Guard.” So she told
him the whole story, saying, “O my son, the True hath prevailed
and the False hath failed:<a id="r112"></a><a href="#f112" class="c014"><sup>[112]</sup></a> know that Ala al-Din Abu al-Shamat
was indeed thy sire, but it was none save the Emir Khalid who
reared thee and adopted thee as his son. And now, O my child,
when thou seest Ahmad al-Danaf the captain, do thou say to him:—I
conjure thee, by Allah, O my chief, take my blood-revenge on
the murderer of my father Ala al-Din Abu al-Shamat!” So he
went out from his mother——And Shahrazad perceived the dawn
of day and ceased to say her permitted say.</p>

    <div>Now when it was the Two Hundred and Sixty-sixth Night,</div>
  </div>
</div>

</div>

<p class="c000">She said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that Aslan
went out from his mother and, betaking himself to Calamity
Ahmad, kissed his hand. Quoth the captain, “What aileth thee,
O Aslan?” and quoth he, “I know now for certain that my
father was Ali al-Din Abu al-Shamat and I would have thee
take my blood-revenge on his murderer.” He asked, “And who
was thy father’s murderer?” whereto Aslan answered, “Ahmad
Kamakim the Arch-thief.” “Who told thee this?” enquired
he, and Aslan rejoined, “I saw in his hand the jewelled lanthorn
which was lost with the rest of the Caliph’s gear, and I said to
him:—Give me this lanthorn! but he refused, saying, Lives have
been lost on account of this; and told me it was he who had
broken into the palace and stolen the articles and deposited them
in my father’s house.” Then said Ahmad al-Danaf, “When thou
seest the Emir Khalid don his harness of war say to him:—Equip
me like thyself and take me with thee. Then do thou go
forth and perform some feat of prowess before the Commander
of the Faithful, and he will say to thee:—Ask a boon of me, O
Aslan! And do thou make answer, I ask of thee this boon, that
thou take my blood-revenge on my father’s murderer. If he say,
Thy father is yet alive and is the Emir Khalid, the Chief of the
Police; answer thou:—My father was Ala al-Din Abu al-Shamat,
and the Emir Khalid hath a claim upon me only as the foster-father
who adopted me. Then tell him all that passed between
thee and Ahmad Kamakim and say:—O Prince of True Believers,
order him to be searched and I will bring the lanthorn forth from
his bosom.” Thereupon said Aslan to him, “I hear and obey;”
and, returning to the Emir Khalid, found him making ready to
repair to the Caliph’s court and said to him, “I would fain have
thee arm and harness me like thyself and take me with thee
to the Divan.” So he equipped him and carried him thither.
Then the Caliph sallied forth of Baghdad with his troops and they
pitched tents and pavilions without the city; whereupon the host
divided into two parties and forming ranks fell to playing Polo, one
striking the ball with the mall, and another striking it back to him.
Now there was among the troops a spy, who had been hired to
slay the Caliph; so he took the ball and smiting it with the bat
drove it straight at the Caliph’s face, when behold, Aslan fended
<span class="pageno" id="Page_82">82</span>it off and catching it drove it back at him who smote it, so that it
struck him between the shoulders and he fell to the ground. The
Caliph exclaimed, “Allah bless thee, O Aslan!” and they all
dismounted and sat on chairs. Then the Caliph bade them bring
the smiter of the ball before him and said, “Who tempted thee
to do this thing and art thou friend or foe?” Quoth he, “I am
thy foe and it was my purpose to kill thee.” Asked the Caliph,
“And wherefore? Art not a Moslem?” Replied the spy; “No!
I am a Rejecter.”<a id="r113"></a><a href="#f113" class="c014"><sup>[113]</sup></a> So the Caliph bade them put him to death
and said to Aslan, “Ask a boon of me.” Quoth he, “I ask of
thee this boon, that thou take my blood-revenge on my father’s
murderer.” He said, “Thy father is alive and there he stands
on his two feet.” “And who is he?” asked Aslan; and the
Caliph answered, “He is the Emir Khalid, Chief of Police.”
Rejoined Aslan, “O Commander of the Faithful, he is no father
of mine, save by right of fosterage; my father was none other
than Ala al-Din Abu al-Shamat.” “Then thy father was a
traitor,” cried the Caliph. “Allah forbid, O Commander of the
Faithful,” rejoined Aslan, “that the ‘Trusty’ should be a traitor!
But how did he betray thee?” Quoth the Caliph, “He stole my
habit and what was therewith.” Aslan retorted, “O Commander
of the Faithful, Allah forfend that my father should be a traitor!
But, O my lord, when thy habit was lost and found didst thou
likewise recover the lanthorn which was stolen from thee?”
Answered the Caliph, “We never got it back;” and Aslan said,
“I saw it in the hands of Ahmad Kamakim and begged it of him;
but he refused to give it me, saying:—Lives have been lost on
account of this. Then he told me of the sickness of Habzalam
Bazazah, son of the Emir Khalid, by reason of his passion for
the damsel Jessamine, and how he himself was released from bonds
and that it was he who stole the habit and the lamp: so do thou,
O Commander of the Faithful, take my blood-revenge for my
father on him who murdered him.” At once the Caliph cried,
“Seize ye Ahmad Kamakim!” and they seized him; whereupon
he asked, “Where be the Captain, Ahmad al-Danaf?” And when
he was summoned the Caliph bade him search Kamakim; so he
put his hand into the thief’s bosom and pulled out the lanthorn.
<span class="pageno" id="Page_83">83</span>Said the Caliph, “Come hither, thou traitor: whence hadst thou
this lanthorn?” and Kamakim replied, “I bought it, O Commander
of the Faithful!” The Caliph rejoined, “Where didst
thou buy it?” Then they beat him till he owned that he had
stolen the lanthorn, the habit and the rest, and the Caliph said
“What moved thee to do this thing O traitor, and ruin Ala al-Din
Abu al-Shamat, the Trusty and Faithful?” Then he bade them
lay hands on him and on the Chief of Police, but the Chief said,
“O Commander of the Faithful, indeed I am unjustly treated;
thou badest me hang him, and I had no knowledge of this trick,
for the plot was contrived between the old woman and Ahmad
Kamakim and my wife. I crave thine intercession,<a id="r114"></a><a href="#f114" class="c014"><sup>[114]</sup></a> O Aslan.”
So Aslan interceded for him with the Caliph, who said, “What
hath Allah done with this youngster’s mother?” Answered Khalid,
“She is with me,” and the Caliph continued, “I command that
thou order thy wife to dress her in her own clothes and ornaments
and restore her to her former degree, a lady of rank; and do thou
remove the seals from Ala al-Din’s house and give his son possession
of his estate.” “I hear and obey,” answered Khalid; and,
going forth, gave the order to his wife who clad Jessamine in her
own apparel; whilst he himself removed the seals from Ala
al-Din’s house and gave Aslan the keys. Then said the Caliph,
“Ask a boon of me, O Aslan;” and he replied, “I beg of thee the
boon to unite me with my father.” Whereat the Caliph wept and
said, “Most like thy sire was he that was hanged and is dead; but
by the life of my forefathers, whoso bringeth me the glad news
that he is yet in the bondage of this life, I will give him all he
seeketh!” Then came forward Ahmad al-Danaf and, kissing the
ground between his hands, said, “Grant me indemnity, O Commander
of the Faithful!” “Thou hast it,” answered the Caliph;
and Calamity Ahmad said, “I give thee the good news that Ala
al-Din Abu al-Shamat, the Trusty, the Faithful, is alive and well.”
Quoth the Caliph “What is this thou sayest?” Quoth Al-Danaf,
“As thy head liveth I say sooth; for I ransomed him with
another, of those who deserved death; and carried him to
Alexandria, where I opened for him a shop and set him up as
dealer in second-hand goods.” Then said the Prince of True
Believers——And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and
ceased saying her permitted say.</p>

    <div>Now when it was the Two Hundred and Sixty-seventh Night,</div>
  </div>
</div>

</div>

<p class="c000">She said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that the
Caliph ordered Calamity Ahmad, saying, “I charge thee fetch
him to me;” and the other replied, “To hear is to obey;” whereupon
the Caliph bade them give him ten thousand gold pieces and
he fared forth for Alexandria. On this wise it happed with Aslan;
but as regards his father, Ala al-Din Abu al-Shamat, he sold
in course of time all that was in his shop excepting a few
things and amongst them a long bag of leather. And happening
to shake the bag there fell out a jewel which filled the palm
of the hand, hanging to a chain of gold and having many facets
but especially five, whereon were names and talismanic characters,
as they were ant-tracks. So he rubbed each face; but none
answered him<a id="r115"></a><a href="#f115" class="c014"><sup>[115]</sup></a> and he said to himself, “Doubtless it is a piece of
variegated onyx;” and then hung it up in the shop. And behold,
a Consul<a id="r116"></a><a href="#f116" class="c014"><sup>[116]</sup></a> passed along the street; and, raising his eyes, saw the
jewel hanging up; so he seated himself over against the shop and
said to Ala al-Din, “O my lord, is the jewel for sale?” He
answered, “All I have is for sale.” Thereupon the Frank said,
“Wilt thou sell me that same for eighty thousand dinars?” “Allah
open!” replied Ala al-Din. The Frank asked, “Wilt thou sell it
for an hundred thousand dinars?”; and he answered, “I sell it to
thee for a hundred thousand dinars; pay me down the monies.”
Quoth the Consul, “I cannot carry about such sum as its price,
for there be robbers and sharpers in Alexandria; but come with
me to my ship and I will pay thee the price and give thee to boot
a bale of Angora wool, a bale of satin, a bale of velvet and a bale
of broadcloth.” So Ala al-Din rose and locked up his shop, after
giving the jewel to the Frank, and committed the keys to his
neighbour, saying, “Keep these keys in trust for me, whilst I go
with this Consul to his ship and return with the price of my jewel.
If I be long absent and there come to thee Ahmad al-Danaf, the
Captain who stablished in this shop, give him the keys and tell
him where I am.” Then he went with the Consul to his ship and
no sooner had he boarded it than the Frank set him a stool and,
<span class="pageno" id="Page_85">85</span>making him sit down, said to his men, “Bring the money.” So
they brought it and he paid him the price of the jewel and gave
him the four bales he had promised him and one over; after which
he said to him, “O my lord, honour me by accepting a bite or a
sup” And Ala al-Din answered, “If thou have any water, give
me to drink.” So the Frank called for sherbets and they brought
drink drugged with Bhang, of which no sooner had Ala al-Din drunk,
than he fell over on his back; whereupon they stowed away the
chairs and shipped the shoving-poles and made sail. Now the wind
blew fair for them till it drove them into blue water; and when
they were beyond sight of land the Kaptán<a id="r117"></a><a href="#f117" class="c014"><sup>[117]</sup></a> bade bring Ala al-Din
up out of the hold and made him smell the counter-drug of Bhang;
whereupon he opened his eyes and said, “Where am I?” He
replied, “Thou art bound and in my power and if thou hadst said,
Allah open! to an hundred thousand dinars for the jewel, I would
have bidden thee more.” “What art thou?” asked Ala al-Din,
and the other answered, “I am a sea-captain and mean to carry
thee to my sweetheart.” Now as they were talking, behold, a ship
hove in sight carrying forty Moslem merchants; so the Frank
captain attacked the vessel and made fast to it with grappling-irons;
then he boarded it with his men and took it and plundered
it; after which he sailed on with his prize, till he reached the city
of Genoa. There the Kaptan, who was carrying off Ala al-Din,
landed and repaired to a palace whose postern gave upon the sea,
and behold, there came down to him a damsel in a chin-veil who
said, “Hast thou brought the jewel and the owner?” “I have
brought them both,” answered he; and she said, “Then give me
the jewel.” So he gave it to her; and, returning to the port, fired
his cannon to announce his safe return; whereupon the King of
the city, being notified of that Kaptan’s arrival, came down to
receive him and asked him, “How hath been this voyage?” He
answered, “A right prosperous one, and while voyaging I have
made prize of a ship with one-and forty Moslem merchants.” Said
the King, “Land them at the port:” so he landed the merchants
in irons and Ala al-Din among the rest; and the King and the
Kaptan mounted and made the captives walk before them till they
reached the audience-chamber, when the Franks seated themselves
<span class="pageno" id="Page_86">86</span>and caused the prisoners to pass in parade order, one by one
before the King who said to the first, “O Moslem, whence comest
thou?” He answered, “From Alexandria;” whereupon the King
said, “O headsman, put him to death.” So the sworder smote him
with the sword and cut off his head: and thus it fared with the
second and the third, till forty were dead and there remained but
Ala al-Din, who drank the cup of his comrades’ sighs and agony
and said to himself, “Allah have mercy on thee, O Ala al-Din.
Thou art a dead man.” Then said the King to him, “And thou,
what countryman art thou?” He answered, “I am of Alexandria,”
and the King said, “O headsman, strike off his head.”
So the sworder raised arm and sword, and was about to strike,
when behold, an old woman of venerable aspect presented herself
before the King, who rose to do her honour, and said to him,
“O King, did I not bid thee remember, when the Captain came
back with captives, to keep one or two for the convent, to serve in
the church?” The King replied, “O my mother, would thou hadst
come a while earlier! But take this one that is left.” So she
turned to Ala al-Din and said to him, “Say, wilt thou serve in the
church, or shall I let the King slay thee?” Quoth he, “I will serve
in the church.” So she took him and carried him forth of the
court and went to the church, where he said to her, “What service
must I do?” She replied, “Thou must rise with the dawn and
take five mules and go with them to the forest and there cut dry
fire-wood and saw it short and bring it to the convent-kitchen.
Then must thou take up the carpets and sweep and wipe the stone
and marble pavements and lay the carpets down again, as they
were; after which thou must take two bushels and a half of wheat
and bolt it and grind it and knead it and make it into cracknels<a id="r118"></a><a href="#f118" class="c014"><sup>[118]</sup></a>
for the convent; and thou must take also a bushel of lentils<a id="r119"></a><a href="#f119" class="c014"><sup>[119]</sup></a> and
sift and crush and cook them. Then must thou fetch water in
barrels and fill the four fountains; after which thou must take
three hundred and threescore and six wooden bowls<a id="p86"></a> and crumble
the cracknels therein and pour of the lentil-pottage over each and
carry every monk and patriarch his bowl.” Said Ala al-Din,<a id="r120"></a><a href="#f120" class="c014"><sup>[120]</sup></a>
“Take me back to the King and let him kill me, it were easier to
<span class="pageno" id="Page_87">87</span>me than this service.” Replied the old woman, “If thou do truly
and rightly the service that is due from thee thou shalt escape
death; but, if thou do it not, I will let the King kill thee.” And
with these words Ala al-Din was left sitting heavy at heart. Now
there were in the church ten blind cripples, and one of them said to
him, “Bring me a pot.” So he brought it him and he cacked and
eased himself therein and said, “Throw away the ordure.” He did
so, and the blind man said, “The Messiah’s blessing be upon thee,
O servant of the church!” Presently behold, the old woman came
in and said to him, “Why hast thou not done thy service in the
church?” Answered he, “How many hands have I, that I should
suffice for all this work?” She rejoined, “Thou fool, I brought thee
not hither except to work;” and she added, “Take, O my son, this
rod (which was of copper capped with a cross) and go forth into
the highway and, when thou meetest the governor of the city, say
to him:—I summon thee to the service of the church, in the name
of our Lord the Messiah. And he will not disobey thee. Then
make him take the wheat, sift, grind, bolt, knead, and bake it into
cracknels; and if any gainsay thee, beat him and fear none.” “To
hear is to obey,” answered he and did as she said, and never ceased
pressing great and small into his service; nor did he leave to do
thus for the space of seventeen years. Now one day as he sat in
church lo! the old woman came to him and said, “Go forth of the
convent.” He asked, “Whither shall I go?” and she answered,
“Thou canst pass the night in a tavern or with one of thy comrades.”
Quoth he, “Why dost thou send me forth of the church?”
and quoth she, “The Princess Husn Maryam, daughter of Yohanná,<a id="r121"></a><a href="#f121" class="c014"><sup>[121]</sup></a>
King of this city, purposeth to visit the church and it
befitteth not that any abide in her way.” So he made a show of
obeying her orders and rose up and pretended that he was leaving
the church; but he said in his mind, “I wonder whether the
Princess is like our women or fairer than they! At any rate I
will not go till I have had a look at her.” So he hid himself in a
closet with a window looking into the church and, as he watched,
<span class="pageno" id="Page_88">88</span>behold, in came the King’s daughter. He cast at her one glance
of eyes that cost him a thousand sighs, for he found her like the
full moon when it cometh swimming out of the clouds; and he
saw with her a young lady——And Shahrazad perceived the
dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say.</p>

<div class="nf-center c005">
    <div>Now when it was the Two Hundred and Sixty-eighth Night,</div>
  </div>
</div>

</div>

<p class="c000">She said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that when Ala
al-Din looked at the King’s daughter, he saw with her a young
lady to whom he heard her say, “Thy company hath cheered me,
O Zubaydah.” So he looked straitly at the damsel and found her
to be none other than his dead wife, Zubaydah the Lutist. Then
the Princess said to Zubaydah, “Come, play us an air on the lute.”
But she answered, “I will make no music for thee, till thou grant
my wish and keep thy word to me.” Asked the Princess, “And
what did I promise thee?”; and Zubaydah answered, “That thou
wouldst reunite me with my husband Ala al-Din Abu al-Shamat,
the Trusty, the Faithful.” Rejoined the Princess, “O Zubaydah,
be of good cheer and keep thine eyes cool and clear; play us a
piece as a thank-offering and an ear-feast for reunion with thy
husband Ala al-Din.” “Where is he?” asked Zubaydah, and
Maryam answered, “He is in yonder closet listening to our words.”
So Zubaydah played on the lute a melody which had made a rock
dance for glee; and when Ala al-Din heard it, his bowels yearned
towards her and he came forth from the closet and, throwing himself
upon his wife Zubaydah, strained her to his bosom. She also
knew him and the twain embraced and fell to the ground in a swoon.
Then came forward the Princess Husn Maryam and sprinkled
rose-water on them, till they revived when she said to them,
“Allah hath reunited you.” Replied Ala al-Din, “By thy kind
offices, O lady.” Then, turning to his wife, he said to her, “O
Zubaydah, thou didst surely die and we tombed thee in the tomb:
how then returnedst thou to life and camest thou to this place?”
She answered, “O my lord, I did not die; but an Aun<a id="r122"></a><a href="#f122" class="c014"><sup>[122]</sup></a> of the
<span class="pageno" id="Page_89">89</span>Jinn snatched me up and flew with me hither. She whom thou
buriedst was a Jinniyah, who shaped herself to my shape and
feigned herself dead; but when you entombed her she broke open
the tomb and came forth from it and returned to the service of
this her mistress, the Princess Husn Maryam. As for me I was
possessed<a id="r123"></a><a href="#f123" class="c014"><sup>[123]</sup></a> and, when I opened my eyes, I found myself with
this Princess thou seest; so I said to her:—Why hast thou
brought me hither. Replied she:—I am predestined to marry
thy husband, Ala al-Din Abu al-Shamat: wilt thou then, O Zubaydah,
accept me to co-consort, a night for me and a night for
thee? Rejoined I:—To hear is to obey, O my lady, but where
is my husband? Quoth she:—Upon his forehead is written
what Allah hath decreed to him; as soon as the writing which
is there writ is fulfilled to him, there is no help for it but he
come hither, and we will beguile the time of our separation
from him with songs and playing upon instruments of music,
till it please Allah to unite us with him. So I abode all
these days with her till Allah brought us together in this
church.” Then Husn Maryam turned to him and said, “O my
lord, Ala al-Din, wilt thou be to me baron and I be to the
femme?” Quoth he, “O my lady, I am a Moslem and thou art
a Nazarene; so how can I intermarry with thee?” Quoth she,
“Allah forbid that I should be an infidel! Nay, I am a Moslemah;
for these eighteen years I have held fast the Faith of Al-Islam
and I am pure of any creed other than that of the Islamite.”
Then said he, “O my lady, I desire a return to my native land;”
and she replied, “Know that I see written on thy forehead things
which thou must needs accomplish, and then thou shalt win to thy
will. Moreover, be lief and fain, O Ala al-Din, that there hath
been born to thee a son named Aslan; who now being arrived at
age of discretion, sitteth in thy place with the Caliph. Know
also that Truth hath prevailed and that Falsehood naught availed;
and that the Lord hath withdrawn the curtain of secrecy from him
who stole the Caliph’s goods, that is, Ahmad Kamakim the arch-thief
and traitor; and he now lieth bound and in jail. And know
further ‘twas I who sent thee the jewel and had it put in the bag
where thou foundest it, and ‘twas I who sent the captain that
brought thee and the jewel; for thou must know that the man
<span class="pageno" id="Page_90">90</span>is enamoured of me and seeketh my favours and would possess
me; but I refused to yield to his wishes or let him have his will
of me; and I said to him:—Thou shalt never have me till thou
bring me the jewel and its owner. So I gave him an hundred
purses and despatched him to thee, in the habit of a merchant,
whereas he is a captain and a war-man; and when they led thee
to thy death after slaying the forty captives, I also sent thee this
old woman to save thee from slaughter.” Said he, “Allah requite
thee for us with all good! Indeed thou hast done well.” Then
Husn Maryam renewed at his hands her profession of Al-Islam;
and, when he was assured of the truth of her speech, he said to
her, “O my lady, tell me what are the virtues of this jewel and
whence cometh it?” She answered, “This jewel came from an
enchanted hoard, and it hath five virtues which will profit us in
time of need. Now my lady grandmother, the mother of my
father, was an enchantress and skilled in solving secrets and
finding hidden treasures from one of the which came the jewel
into her hands. And as I grew up and reached the age of
fourteen, I read the Evangel and other books and I found the
name of Mohammed (whom Allah bless and preserve!) in the
four books, namely the Evangel, the Pentateuch, the Psalms and
the Koran;<a id="r124"></a><a href="#f124" class="c014"><sup>[124]</sup></a> so I believed in Mohammed and became a Moslemah,
being certain and assured that none is worship-worth
save Allah Almighty, and that to the Lord of all mankind no
faith is acceptable save that of Al-Islam. Now when my lady-grandmother
fell sick, she gave me this jewel and taught me
its five virtues. Moreover, before she died, my father said to
her:—Take thy tablets of geomancy and throw a figure, and
tell us the issue of my affair and what will befal me. And she
foretold him that the far-off one<a id="r125"></a><a href="#f125" class="c014"><sup>[125]</sup></a> should die, slain by the hand
of a captive from Alexandria. So he swore to kill every prisoner
from that place and told the Kaptan of this, saying:—There is
no help for it but thou fall on the ships of the Moslems and seize
<span class="pageno" id="Page_91">91</span>them and whomsoever thou findest of Alexandria, kill him or
bring him to me. The Captain did his bidding until he had slain
as many in number as the hairs of his head. Then my grandmother
died and I took a geomantic tablet, being minded and
determined to know the future, and I said to myself:—Let me see
who will wed me! Whereupon I threw a figure and found that
none should be my husband save one called Ala al-Din Abu al-Shamat,
the Trusty, the Faithful. At this I marvelled and waited
till the times were accomplished and I foregathered with thee.”
So Ala al-Din took her to wife and said to her, “I desire to
return to my own country.” Quoth she, “If it be so, rise up and
come with me.” Then she took him and, hiding him in a closet
of her palace, went in to her father, who said to her, “O my
daughter, my heart is exceeding heavy this day; sit down and let
us make merry with wine, I and thou.” So she sat down with
him and he called for a table of wine; and she plied him till he
lost his wits, when she drugged a cup with Bhang and he drank it
off and fell upon his back. Then she brought Ala al-Din out of
the closet and said to him, “Come; verily thine enemy lieth prostrate,
for I made him drunk and drugged him; so do thou with
him as thou wilt.” Accordingly Ala al-Din went to the King and,
finding him lying drugged and helpless, pinioned him fast and
manacled and fettered him with chains. Then he gave him the
counter-drug and he came to himself——And Shahrazad perceived
the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say.</p>

<p class="c000">She said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that Ala al-Din
gave the antidote of Bhang to King Yohanna, father of Husn
Maryam, and he came to himself and found Ala al-Din and his
daughter sitting on his breast. So he said to her, “O my
daughter, dost thou deal thus with me?” She answered “If I be
indeed thy daughter, become a Moslem, even as I became a
Moslemah; for the truth was shown to me and I attested it;
and the false, and I deserted it. I have submitted myself unto
Allah, The Lord of the Three Worlds, and am pure of all faiths
contrary to that of Al-Islam in this world and in the next world.
Wherefore, if thou wilt become a Moslem, well and good; if not,
thy death were better than thy life.” Ala al-Din also exhorted
<span class="pageno" id="Page_92">92</span>him to embrace the True Faith; but he refused and was contumacious;
so Ala al-Din drew a dagger and cut his throat from
ear to ear.<a id="r126"></a><a href="#f126" class="c014"><sup>[126]</sup></a> Then he wrote a scroll, setting forth what had happened
and laid it on the brow of the dead; after which they
took what was light of load and weighty of worth and turned from
the palace and returned to the church. Here the Princess drew
forth the jewel and, placing her hand upon the facet where was
figured a couch, rubbed it; and behold, a couch appeared before
her and she mounted upon it with Ala al-Din and his wife,
Zubaydah, the Lutist, saying, “I conjure thee by the virtue of the
names and talismans and characts engraven on this jewel, rise up
with us, O Couch!” And it rose with them into the air and flew,
till it came to a Wady wholly bare of growth, when the Princess
turned earthwards the facet on which the couch was figured, and it
sank with them to the ground. Then she turned up the face whereon
was fashioned a pavilion and tapping it said, “Let a pavilion be
pitched in this valley;” and there appeared a pavilion, wherein
they seated themselves. Now this Wady was a desert waste, without
grass or water; so she turned a third face of the jewel towards
the sky, and said, “By the virtue of the names of Allah, let trees
upgrow here and a river flow beside them!” And forthwith trees
sprang up and by their side ran a river plashing and dashing.
They made the ablution and prayed and drank of the stream; after
which the Princess turned up the three other facets till she came to
the fourth, whereon was portrayed a table of food, and said, “By
the virtue of the names of Allah, let the table be spread!” And
behold, there appeared before them a table, spread with all manner
of rich meats, and they ate and drank and made merry and were
full of joy. Such was their case; but as regards Husn Maryam’s
father, his son went in to waken him and found him slain; and,
seeing Ala al-Din’s scroll, took it and read it, and readily understood
it. Then he sought his sister and finding her not, betook
himself to the old woman in the church, of whom he enquired for
her, but she said, “Since yesterday I have not seen her.” So he
returned to the troops and cried out, saying, “To horse, ye horsemen!”
Then he told them what had happened, so they mounted
and rode after the fugitives, till they drew near the pavilion.
Presently Husn Maryam arose and looked up and saw a cloud of
<span class="pageno" id="Page_93">93</span>dust which spread till it walled the view, then it lifted and flew,
and lo! stood disclosed her brother and his troops, crying aloud,
“Whither will ye fly, and we on your track!” Then said she to
Ala al-Din, “Are thy feet firm in fight?” He replied, “Even as
the stake in bran, I know not war nor battle, nor swords nor
spears.” So she pulled out the jewel and rubbed the fifth face,
that on which were graven a horse and his rider, and behold,
straightway a cavalier appeared out of the desert and ceased not
to do battle with the pursuing host and smite them with the sword,
till he routed them and put them to flight. Then the Princess
asked Ala al-Din, “Wilt thou go to Cairo or to Alexandria?”;
and he answered, “To Alexandria.” So they mounted the couch
and she pronounced over it the conjuration, whereupon it set off
with them and, in the twinkling of an eye, brought them to Alexandria.
They alighted without the city and Ala al-Din hid the
women in a cavern, whilst he went into Alexandria and fetched
them outer clothing, wherewith he covered them. Then he carried
them to his shop and, leaving them in the “ben”<a id="r127"></a><a href="#f127" class="c014"><sup>[127]</sup></a> walked forth to
fetch them the morning-meal, and behold, he met Calamity Ahmad
who chanced to be coming from Baghdad. He saw him in the
street and received him with open arms, saluting him and welcoming
him. Whereupon Ahmad al-Danaf gave him the good
news of his son Aslan and how he was now come to the age of
twenty: and Ala al-Din, in his turn, told the Captain of the Guard
all that had befallen him from first to last, whereat he marvelled
with exceeding marvel. Then he brought him to his shop and
sitting-room where they passed the night; and next day he sold
his place of business and laid its price with other monies. Now
Ahmad al-Danaf had told him that the Caliph sought him; but
he said, “I am bound first for Cairo, to salute my father and mother
and the people of my house.” So they all mounted the couch and
it carried them to Cairo the God-guarded; and here they alighted in
the street called Yellow,<a id="r128"></a><a href="#f128" class="c014"><sup>[128]</sup></a> where stood the house of Shams al-Din.
Then Ala al-Din knocked at the door, and his mother said, “Who
is at the door, now that we have lost our beloved for evermore?”
He replied, “’Tis I! Ala al-Din!” whereupon they came down
and embraced him. Then he sent his wives and baggage into the
house and entering himself with Ahmad al-Danaf, rested there
<span class="pageno" id="Page_94">94</span>three days, after which he was minded to set out for Baghdad.
His father said, “Abide with me, O my son;” but he answered,
“I cannot bear to be parted from my child Aslan.” So he took
his father and mother and fared forth for Baghdad. Now when
they came thither, Ahmad al-Danaf went in to the Caliph and gave
him the glad tidings of Ala al-Din’s arrival and told him his story;
whereupon the King went forth to greet him taking the youth
Aslan, and they met and embraced each other. Then the Commander
of the Faithful summoned the arch-thief Ahmad Kamakim
and said to Ala al-Din, “Up and at thy foe!” So he drew
his sword and smote off Ahmad Kamakim’s head. Then the
Caliph held festival for Ala al-Din and, summoning the Kazis
and witnesses, wrote the contract and married him to the Princess
Husn Maryam; and he went in unto her and found her an
unpierced pearl. Moreover, the Caliph made Aslan Chief of the
Sixty and bestowed upon him and his father sumptuous dresses of
honour; and they abode in the enjoyment of all joys and joyance
of life, till there came to them the Destroyer of delights and the
Sunderer of societies. But the tales of generous men are manifold
and amongst them is the story of</p>

<p class="c000"><span class="label"><a href="#r28">28</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Arab. “Barsh” or “Bars,” the commonest kind. In India it is called Ma’jún
(= electuary, generally): it is made of Ganja or young leaves, buds, capsules and florets
of hemp (<em>C. sativa</em>), poppy-seed and flowers of the thorn-apple (<em>datura</em>) with milk and
sugar-candy, nutmegs, cloves, mace and saffron, all boiled to the consistency of treacle
which hardens when cold. Several recipes are given by Herklots (Glossary <i><span xml:lang="la" lang="la">s. v.</span></i>
Majoon). These electuaries are usually prepared with “Charas,” or gum of hemp,
collected by hand or by passing a blanket over the plant in early morning, and it is
highly intoxicating. Another intoxicant is “Sabzi,” dried hemp-leaves, poppy-seed,
cucumber-seed, black pepper and cardamoms rubbed down in a mortar with a wooden
pestle, and made drinkable by adding milk, ice-cream, etc. The Hashish of Arabia is
the Hindustani Bhang, usually drunk and made as follows. Take of hemp-leaves, well
washed, 3 drams; black pepper 45 grains and of cloves, nutmeg and mace (which add to
the intoxication) each 12 grains. Triturate in 8 ounces of water or the juice of watermelon
or cucumber, strain and drink. The Egyptian Zabíbah is a preparation of hemp-florets,
opium and honey, much affected by the lower orders, whence the proverb:
“Temper thy sorrow with Zabibah,.” In Al-Hijaz it is mixed with raisins (Zabíb) and
smoked in the water-pipe. (Burckhardt No. 73). Besides these there is (1) “Post”
poppy-seed prepared in various ways but especially in sugared sherbets; (2) Datura
(<em>stramonium</em>) seed, the produce of the thorn-apple, bleached and put into sweetmeats
by dishonest confectioners; it is a dangerous intoxicant, producing spectral visions,
delirium tremens, etc.; and (3) various preparations of opium especially the “Madad,”
pills made up with toasted betel-leaf and smoked. Opium, however, is usually drunk
in the shape of “Kusumba,” a pill placed in wet cotton and squeezed in order to strain
and clean it of the cowdung and other filth with which it is adulterated.</p>

in the hand, still acts as an aphrodisiac in the East, and which in the Middle Ages was
considered a universal medicine. In the “Adja’ib al-Hind” (<span xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">Les Merveilles de l’Inde</span>)
we find a notice of a bald-headed old man who was compelled to know his wife twice a
day and twice a night in consequence of having eaten a certain fish. (Chapt. lxxviii. of
the translation by M. L. Marcel Devic, from a manuscript of the tenth century; Paris,
Lemaire, 1878). Europeans deride these prescriptions, but Easterns know better: they
affect the fancy, that is, the brain; and often succeed in temporarily relieving impotence.
The recipes for this evil, which is incurable only when it comes from heart-affections, are
innumerable in the East; and about half of every medical work is devoted to them.
Many a quack has made his fortune with a few bottles of tincture of cantharides, and a
man who could discover a specific would become a millionaire in India only. The
curious reader will consult for specimens the Ananga-Ranga Shastra by Koka Pandit;
or the “Rujú ‘al-Shaykh ila ‘l-Sabáh fi Kuwwati ‘l-Báh” (the Return of the Old Man
to Youth in power of Procreation) by Ahmad bin Sulaymán known as Ibn Kamál

a host of other names for which see Mr. Rodwell who, however, should not write
“Fatthah” (p. xxv.) nor “Fathah” (xxvii.). The Fátihah, which is to Al-Islam much
what the “Paternoster” is to Christendom, consists of seven verses, in the usual Saj’a or
rhymed prose, and I have rendered it as follows:—</p>

<p class="c000">In the name of the Compassionating, the Compassionate! ✿ Praise be to Allah who
all the Worlds made ✿ The Compassionating, the Compassionate ✿ King of the Day
of Faith! ✿ Thee only do we adore and of Thee only do we crave aid ✿ Guide us to
the path which is straight ✿ The path of those for whom Thy love is great, not those on
whom is hate, nor they that deviate ✿ Amen! O Lord of the World’s trine.</p>

three Caliphs: the name is taken from their own saying “Inná rafizná-hum” = verily
we have rejected them. The feeling between Sunni (the so-called orthodox) and Shi’ah
is much like the Christian love between a Catholic of Cork and a Protestant from the
Black North. As Al-Siyuti or any historian will show, this sect became exceedingly
powerful under the later Abbaside Caliphs, many of whom conformed to it and adopted
its practices and innovations (as in the Azan or prayer-call), greatly to the scandal of
their co-religionists. Even in the present day the hatred between these representatives
of Arab monotheism and Persian Guebrism continues unabated. I have given sundry
instances in my Pilgrimage, <i><span xml:lang="la" lang="la">e.g.</span></i> how the Persians attempt to pollute the tombs of the

a life of devotion in Cairo, dying in A.H. 218 = 824. The corpse of the Imam al-Shafi’i
was carried to her house, now her mosque and mausoleum: it stood in the Darb
al-Sabúa which formerly divided Old from New Cairo and is now one of the latter’s
suburbs. Lane (M. E. chapt. x.) gives her name but little more. The mention of

wedding, and bedding with actual consummation, at once divorces the woman. He is
held the reverse of respectable and no wonder. Hence, probably, Mandeville’s story of
the Islanders who, on the marriage-night, “make another man to lie by their wives, to
have their maidenhead, for which they give great hire and much thanks. And there are
certain men in every town that serve for no other thing; and they call them cadeberiz,
that is to say, the fools of despair, because they believe their occupation is a dangerous
one.” Burckhardt gives the proverb (No. 79), “A thousand lovers rather than one
Mustahall,” the latter being generally some ugly fellow picked up in the streets and disgusting

traitorous words. This is the old tale of Coronis and Apollo (Ovid, lib. ii.)</p>

the subject of these patronymics Lane (Mod. Egypt, chapt. iv.) has a strange remark

Abraham and the horns of the ram sacrificed in lieu of Ishmael, which (if true) would

<p class="c013">It is told of Hátim of the tribe of Tayy,<a id="r129"></a><a href="#f129" class="c014"><sup>[129]</sup></a> that when he died, they
buried him on the top of a mountain and set over his grave two
troughs hewn out of two rocks and stone girls with dishevelled hair.
At the foot of the hill was a stream of running water, and when
wayfarers camped there, they heard loud crying and keening in
the night, from dark till daybreak; but when they arose in the
morning, they found nothing but the girls carved in stone. Now
<span class="pageno" id="Page_95">95</span>when Zú ‘l-Kurá’a,<a id="r130"></a><a href="#f130" class="c014"><sup>[130]</sup></a> King of Himyar, going forth of his tribe,

<p class="c000">She said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that when Zu
‘l-Kura’a passed by the valley he nighted there; and, when he
drew near the mountain, he heard the keening and said, “What
lamenting is that on yonder hill?” They answered him, saying,
“Verily this be the tomb of Hatim al-Táyyi over which are two
troughs of stone and stone figures of girls with dishevelled hair; and
all who camp in this place by night hear this crying and keening.”
So he said jestingly, “O Hatim of Tayy! we are thy guests this
night, and we are lank with hunger.” Then sleep overcame him,
but presently he awoke in affright and cried out, saying, “Help,
O Arabs! Look to my beast!” So they came to him, and finding
his she-camel struggling and struck down, they stabbed her in the
throat and roasted her flesh and ate. Then they asked him what
had happened and he said, “When I closed my eyes, I saw in my
sleep Hatim of Tayy who came to me sword in hand and cried:—Thou
comest to us and we have nothing by us. Then he smote
my she-camel with his sword, and she had surely died even though
ye had not come to her and slaughtered her.”<a id="r131"></a><a href="#f131" class="c014"><sup>[131]</sup></a> Now when morning
dawned the King mounted the beast of one of his companions
and, taking the owner up behind him, set out and fared on till
midday, when they saw a man coming towards them, mounted on
a camel and leading another, and said to him, “Who art thou?”
He answered, “I am Adi,<a id="r132"></a><a href="#f132" class="c014"><sup>[132]</sup></a> son of Hatim of Tayy; where is Zu
‘l-Kura’a, Emir of Himyar?” Replied they, “This is he;” and
he said to the prince, “Take this she-camel in place of thy beast
which my father slaughtered for thee.” Asked Zu ‘l-Kura’a, “Who
<span class="pageno" id="Page_96">96</span>told thee of this?” and Adi answered, “My father appeared to me
in a dream last night and said to me:—Harkye, Adi; Zu ‘l-Kura’a
King of Himyar, sought the guest-rite of me and I, having naught
to give him, slaughtered his she-camel, that he might eat: so do
thou carry him a she-camel to ride, for I have nothing.” And Zu
‘l-Kura’a took her, marvelling at the generosity of Hatim of Tayy
alive and dead. And amongst instances of generosity is the</p>

Their Chief, who died a few years before Mohammed’s birth, was Al-Halim (the “black

he will enter Heaven with the Moslems. Hatim was buried on the hill called Owárid:
I have already noted this favourite practice of the wilder Arabs and the affecting idea
that the Dead may still look upon his kith and kin. There is not an Arab book nor,
indeed, a book upon Arabia which does not contain the name of Hatim: he is mentioned
as unpleasantly often as Aristides.</p>

<p class="c000"><span class="label"><a href="#r133">133</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>A rival in generosity to Hatim: a Persian poet praising his patron’s generosity says
that it buried that of Hatim and dimmed that of Ma’an (D’Herbelot). He was a high
official under the last Ommiade, Marwán al-Himár (the “Ass,” or the “Century,” the
duration of Ommiade rule) who was routed and slain in A.H. 132 = 750. Ma’an continued
to serve under the Abbasides and was a favourite with Al-Mansúr. “More
generous or bountiful than Ka’ab” is another saying (A. P., i. 325); Ka’ab ibn Mámah
was a man who, somewhat like Sir Philip Sidney at Zutphen, gave his own portion of drink
while he was dying of thirst to a man who looked wistfully at him, whence the saying
“Give drink to thy brother the Námiri” (A. P., i. 608). Ka’ab could not mount, so they
put garments over him to scare away the wild beasts and left him in the desert to die.
“Scatterer of blessings” (Náshir al-Ni’am) was a title of King Malik of Al-Yaman, son
of Sharhabil, eminent for his liberality. He set up the statue in the Western Desert,
inscribed “Nothing behind me,” as a warner to others.</p>

<p class="c013">Now Ma’an bin Záidah went forth one day to the chase with
his company, and they came upon a herd of gazelles; so they
separated in pursuit and Ma’an was left alone to chase one
of them. When he had made prize of it he alighted and
slaughtered it; and as he was thus engaged, he espied a person<a id="r136"></a><a href="#f136" class="c014"><sup>[136]</sup></a>
coming forth out of the desert on an ass. So he remounted and
riding up to the new-comer, saluted him and asked him, “Whence
<span class="pageno" id="Page_98">98</span>comest thou?” Quoth he, “I come from the land of Kuzá’ah,
where we have had a two years’ dearth; but this year it was a
season of plenty and I sowed early cucumbers.<a id="r137"></a><a href="#f137" class="c014"><sup>[137]</sup></a> They came up
before their time, so I gathered what seemed the best of them and
set out to carry them to the Emir Ma’an bin Zaidah, because of
his well-known beneficence and notorious munificence.” Asked
Ma’an, “How much dost thou hope to get of him?”; and the
Badawi answered, “A thousand dinars.” Quoth the Emir, “What
if he say this is too much?” Said the Badawi, “Then I will ask
five hundred dinars.” “And if he say, Too much?” “Then three
hundred!” “And if he say yet, Too much?” “Then two hundred!”
“And if he say yet, Too much?” “Then one hundred!”
“And if he say yet, Too much?” “Then, fifty!” “And if he
say yet, Too much?” “Then thirty!” “And if he say still, Too
much?” asked Ma’an bin Zaidah. Answered the Badawi, “I will
make my ass set his four feet in his Honour’s home<a id="r138"></a><a href="#f138" class="c014"><sup>[138]</sup></a> and return to
my people, disappointed and empty-handed.” So Ma’an laughed
at him and urged his steed till he came up with his suite and
returned to his place, when he said to his chamberlain, “An there
come to thee a man with cucumbers and riding on an ass admit
him to me.” Presently up came the Badawi and was admitted to
Ma’an’s presence; but knew not the Emir for the man he had met
in the desert, by reason of the gravity and majesty of his semblance
and the multitude of his eunuchs and attendants, for he was seated
on his chair of estate with his officers ranged in lines before him
and on either side. So he saluted him and Ma’an said to him
“What bringeth thee, O brother of the Arabs?” Answered the
Badawi, “I hoped in the Emir, and have brought him curly cucumbers
out of season.” Asked Ma’an, “And how much dost thou
expect of us?” “A thousand dinars,” answered the Badawi. “This
is far too much,” quoth Ma’an. Quoth he, “Five hundred.” “Too
much!” “Then three hundred.” “Too much!” “Two hundred.”
“Too much!” “One hundred.” “Too much!” “Fifty.”
“Too much!” At last the Badawi came down to thirty dinars;
but Ma’an still replied, “Too much!” So the Badawi cried, “By
<span class="pageno" id="Page_99">99</span>Allah, the man who met me in the desert brought me bad luck!
But I will not go lower than thirty dinars.” The Emir laughed
and said nothing; whereupon the wild Arab knew that it was he
whom he had met and said, “O my lord, except thou bring the
thirty dinars, see ye, there is the ass tied ready at the door and
here sits Ma’an, his honour, at home.” So Ma’an laughed, till he
fell on his back; and, calling his steward, said to him, “Give him
a thousand dinars and five hundred and three hundred and two
hundred and one hundred and fifty and thirty; and leave the ass
tied up where he is.” So the Arab to his amazement, received two
thousand one hundred and eighty dinars, and Allah have mercy on
them both and on all generous men! And I have also heard,

the number of the Kings. After this time, there came to the

mind to open these locks, that he might see what was within the
tower. The grandees of his kingdom forbade him from this and
pressed him to desist and reproved him and blamed him; but he

<p class="c000">She said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that the grandees
offered that King all their hands possessed of monies and treasures
if he would but refrain; still he would not be baulked and said,
“There is no help for it but I open this tower.” So he pulled off
the locks and entering, found within the tower figures of Arabs on
their horses and camels, habited in turbands<a id="r140"></a><a href="#f140" class="c014"><sup>[140]</sup></a> hanging down at the
ends, with swords in baldrick-belts thrown over their shoulders and
bearing long lances in their hands. He found there also a scroll
which he greedily took and read, and these words were written
therein:—“Whenas this door is opened will conquer this country
a raid of the Arabs, after the likeness of the figures here depicted;
wherefore beware, and again beware of opening it.” Now this city
was in Andalusia; and that very year Tárik ibn Ziyád conquered
it, during the Caliphate of Al-Walíd son of Abd al-Malik<a id="r141"></a><a href="#f141" class="c014"><sup>[141]</sup></a> of the
sons of Umayyah; and slew this King after the sorriest fashion
and sacked the city and made prisoners of the women and boys
therein and got great loot. Moreover, he found there immense
treasures; amongst the rest more than an hundred and seventy
crowns of pearls and jacinths and other gems of price; and he
found a saloon, wherein horsemen might throw the spears, full of
vessels of gold and silver, such as no description can comprise.
Moreover, he found there the table of food for the Prophet of
Allah, Solomon son of David (peace with both of them!), which is
extant even now in a city of the Greeks; it is told that it was of
grass-green emerald with vessels of gold and platters of jasper.
Likewise he found the Psalms written in the old Ionian<a id="r142"></a><a href="#f142" class="c014"><sup>[142]</sup></a> character
on leaves of gold bezel’d with jewels; together with a book
setting forth the properties of stones and herbs and minerals, as
well as the use of characts and talismans and the canons of the
art of alchymy; and he found a third volume which treated of
<span class="pageno" id="Page_101">101</span>the art of cutting and setting rubies and other precious stones and
of the preparation of poisons and theriacks. There found he also
a mappa mundi figuring the earth and the seas and the different
cities and countries and villages of the world; and he found a vast
saloon full of hermetic powder, one drachm of which elixir would
turn a thousand drachms of silver into fine gold; likewise a
marvellous mirror, great and round, of mixed metals, which had
been made for Solomon, son of David (on the twain be peace!)
wherein whoso looked might see the counterfeit presentment of
the seven climates of the world; and he beheld a chamber full
of Brahmini<a id="r143"></a><a href="#f143" class="c014"><sup>[143]</sup></a> jacinths for which no words can suffice. So he
despatched all these things to Walid bin Abd al-Malik, and the
Arabs spread all over the cities of Andalusia which is one of the
finest of lands. This is the end of the story of the City of
Labtayt. And a tale is also told of</p>

  <h2 id="c101" class="c007">THE CALIPH HISHAM AND THE ARAB YOUTH.</h2>
</div>

<p class="c013">The Caliph Hishám bin Abd al-Malik bin Marwan, was hunting
one day, when he sighted an antelope and pursued it with his
dogs. As he was following the quarry, he saw an Arab youth
pasturing sheep and said to him, “Ho boy, up and after yonder
antelope, for it escapeth me!” The youth raised his head to him
and replied, “O ignorant of what to the deserving is due, thou
lookest on me with disdain and speakest to me with contempt;
thy speaking is that of a tyrant true and thy doing what an
ass would do.” Quoth Hisham, “Woe to thee, dost thou not
know me?” Rejoined the youth, “Verily thine unmannerliness
hath made thee known to me, in that thou spakest to me, without
beginning by the salutation.”<a id="r144"></a><a href="#f144" class="c014"><sup>[144]</sup></a> Repeated the Caliph, “Fie upon
thee! I am Hisham bin Abd al-Malik.” “May Allah not favour
thy dwelling-place,” replied the Arab, “nor guard thine abiding
place! How many are thy words and how few thy generous
deeds!” Hardly had he ended speaking, when up came the troop
<span class="pageno" id="Page_102">102</span>from all sides and surrounded him as the white encircleth the
black of the eye, all and each saying, “Peace be with thee, O Commander
of the Faithful!” Quoth Hisham, “Cut short this talk
and seize me yonder boy.” So they laid hands on him; and when
he saw the multitude of Chamberlains and Wazirs and Lords of
State, he was in nowise concerned and questioned not of them, but
let his chin drop on his breast and looked where his feet fell, till
they brought him to the Caliph<a id="r145"></a><a href="#f145" class="c014"><sup>[145]</sup></a> when he stood before him, with
head bowed groundwards and saluted him not and spoke him
not. So one of the eunuchs said to him, “O dog of the Arabs,
what hindereth thy saluting the Commander of the Faithful?”
The youth turned to him angrily and replied, “O packsaddle of an
ass, it was the length of the way that hindered me from this and
the steepness of the steps and the profuseness of my sweat.” Then
said Hisham (and indeed he was exceeding wroth), “O boy, verily
thy days are come to their latest hour; thy hope is gone from
thee and thy life is past out of thee.” He answered, “By Allah,
O Hisham, verily an my life-term be prolonged and Fate ordain
not its cutting short, thy words irk me not, be they long or short.”
Then said the Chief Chamberlain to him, “Doth it befit thy degree,
O vilest of the Arabs, to bandy words with the Commander of the
Faithful?” He answered promptly, “Mayest thou meet with
adversity and may woe and wailing never leave thee! Hast thou
not heard the saying of Almighty Allah?:—One day, every soul
shall come to defend itself.”<a id="r146"></a><a href="#f146" class="c014"><sup>[146]</sup></a> Hereupon Hisham rose, in great
wrath, and said, “O headsman, bring me the head of this lad; for
indeed he exceedeth in talk, such as passeth conception.” So the
sworder took him and, making him kneel on the carpet of blood,
drew his sword above him and said to the Caliph, “O Commander
of the Faithful, this thy slave is misguided and is on the way to
<span class="pageno" id="Page_103">103</span>his grave; shall I smite off his head and be quit of his blood?”
“Yes,” replied Hisham. He repeated his question and the Caliph
again answered in the affirmative. Then he asked leave a third
time; and the youth, knowing that, if the Caliph assented yet
once more, it would be the signal of his death, laughed till his
wisdom-teeth showed; whereupon Hisham’s wrath redoubled and
he said to him, “O boy, meseems thou art mad; seest thou not
that thou art about to depart the world? Why then dost thou
laugh in mockery of thyself?” He replied, “O Commander of
the Faithful, if a larger life-term befel me, none can hurt me, great
or small; but I have bethought me of some couplets, which do
thou hear, for my death cannot escape thee.” Quoth Hisham,
“Say on and be brief;” so the Arab repeated these couplets:—</p>

<div class="lg-container-b c003">
  <div class="linegroup">
    <div class="group">
      <div class="line">It happed one day a hawk pounced on a bird, ✿ A wildling sparrow driven by destiny;</div>
      <div class="line">And held in pounces spake the sparrow thus, ✿ E’en as the hawk rose ready home to hie:—</div>
      <div class="line">“Scant flesh have I to fill the maw of thee ✿ And for thy lordly food poor morsel I.”</div>
      <div class="line">Then smiled the hawk in flattered vanity ✿ And pride, so set the sparrow free to fly.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class="c000">At this Hisham smiled and said, “By the truth of my kinship to
the Apostle of Allah (whom Allah bless and keep!), had he spoken
this speech at first and asked for aught except the Caliphate,
verily I would have given it to him. Stuff his mouth with jewels,<a id="r147"></a><a href="#f147" class="c014"><sup>[147]</sup></a>

them and the Arab went his way. And amongst pleasant tales is

Badawi, which caused the revelation of the Koranic chapter “Inner Apartments”
(No. xlix.) have always been favourite themes with Arab tale-tellers as a contrast with
citizen suavity and servility. Moreover the Badawi, besides saying what he thinks,
always tells the truth (unless corrupted by commerce with foreigners); and this is a
startling contrast with the townsfolk. To ride out of Damascus and have a chat with
the Ruwalá is much like being suddenly transferred from amongst the trickiest of
Mediterranean people to the bluff society of the Scandinavian North. And the reason
why the Turk will never govern the Arab in peace is that the former is always trying to
finesse and to succeed by falsehood, when the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the
truth is wanted.</p>

  <h2 id="c103" class="c007">IBRAHIM BIN AL-MAHDI <span class="fss">AND THE</span> BARBER-SURGEON.</h2>
</div>

<p class="c013">They relate that Ibrahím, son of al-Mahdí,<a id="r148"></a><a href="#f148" class="c014"><sup>[148]</sup></a> brother of Harun
al-Rashid, when the Caliphate devolved to Al-Maamun, the son
of his brother Harun, refused to acknowledge his nephew and
<span class="pageno" id="Page_104">104</span>betook himself to Rayy<a id="r149"></a><a href="#f149" class="c014"><sup>[149]</sup></a>; where he claimed the throne and abode
thus a year and eleven months and twelve days. Meanwhile his
nephew, Al-Maamun, awaited his return to allegiance and his
accepting a dependent position till, at last, despairing of this, he
mounted with his horsemen and footmen and repaired to Rayy in
quest of him. Now when the news came to Ibrahim, he found
nothing for it but to flee to Baghdad and hide there, fearing for
his life; and Maamun set a price of an hundred thousand gold
pieces upon his head, to be paid to whoso might betray him.
(Quoth Ibrahim) “When I heard of this price I feared for my
head”——And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased
to say her permitted say.</p>

<div>

<div class="nf-center-c1">
<div class="nf-center c005">
    <div>Now when it was the Two Hundred and Seventy-third Night,</div>
  </div>
</div>

</div>

<p class="c000">She said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that Ibrahim
continued:—Now when I heard of this price I feared for my head
and knew not what to do: so I went forth of my house in disguise
at midday, knowing not whither I should go. Presently I entered
a broad street which was no thoroughfare and said in my mind,
“Verily, we are Allah’s and unto Him we are returning! I have
exposed my life to destruction. If I retrace my steps, I shall
arouse suspicion.” Then, being still in disguise I espied, at the
upper end of the street, a negro-slave standing at his door; so I
went up to him and said to him, “Hast thou a place where I may
abide for an hour of the day?” “Yes,” answered he, and opening
the door admitted me into a decent house, furnished with carpets
and mats and cushions of leather. Then he shut the door on me
and went away; and I misdoubted me he had heard of the reward
offered for me, and said to myself, “He hath gone to inform
against me.” But, as I sat pondering my case and boiling like
cauldron over fire, behold, my host came back, accompanied by a
porter loaded with bread and meat and new cooking-pots and
gear and a new jar and new gugglets and other needfuls. He
<span class="pageno" id="Page_105">105</span>made the porter set them down and, dismissing him, said to me,
“I offer my life for thy ransom! I am a barber-surgeon, and I
know it would disgust thee to eat with me, because of the way in
which I get my livelihood;<a id="r150"></a><a href="#f150" class="c014"><sup>[150]</sup></a> so do thou shift for thyself and do
what thou please with these things whereon no hand hath fallen.”
(Quoth Ibrahim), Now I was in sore need of food so I cooked me
a pot of meat whose like I remember not ever to have eaten; and,
when I had satisfied my want, he said to me, “O my lord, Allah
make me thy ransom! Art thou for wine?; for indeed it gladdeneth
the soul and doeth away care.” “I have no dislike to it,”
replied I, being desirous of the barber’s company; so he brought
me new flagons of glass which no hand had touched and a jar of
excellent wine, and said to me, “Strain for thyself, to thy liking;”
whereupon I cleared the wine and mixed me a most delectable
draught. Then he brought me a new cup and fruits and flowers
in new vessels of earthenware; after which he said to me, “Wilt
thou give me leave to sit apart and drink of my own wine by
myself, of my joy in thee and for thee?” “Do so,” answered I.
So I drank and he drank till the wine began to take effect upon
us, when the barber rose and, going to a closet, took out a lute of
polished wood and said to me, “O my lord, it is not for the like of
me to ask the like of thee to sing, but it behoveth thine exceeding
generosity to render my respect its due; so, if thou see fit
to honour thy slave, thine is the high decision.” Quoth I (and
indeed I thought not that he knew me), “How knowest thou that
I excel in song?” He replied, “Glory be to Allah, our lord is
too well renowned for that! Thou art my lord Ibrahim, son of
Al-Mahdi, our Caliph of yesterday, he on whose head Al-Maamun
hath set a price of an hundred thousand dinars to be paid to thy
betrayer: but thou art in safety with me.” (Quoth Ibrahim),
When I heard him say this, he was magnified in my eyes and
his loyalty and noble nature were certified to me; so I complied
with his wish and took the lute and tuned it, and sang. Then I
bethought me of my severance from my children and my family
and I began to say:—</p>

<div class="lg-container-b c003">
  <div class="linegroup">
    <div class="group">
      <div class="line">Belike Who Yúsuf to his kin restored ✿ And honoured him in goal, a captive wight;</div>
      <div class="line">May grant our prayer to reunite our lots; ✿ For Allah, Lord of Worlds, hath all of might.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class="c000"><span class="pageno" id="Page_106">106</span>When the barber heard this, exceeding joy took possession of him
and he was of great good cheer; for it is said that when Ibrahim’s
neighbours heard him only sing out, “Ho, boy, saddle the mule!”
they were filled with delight. Then, being overborne by mirth, he
said to me, “O my lord, wilt thou give me leave to say what is
come to my mind, albeit I am not of the folk of this craft?” I
answered, “Do so; this is of thy great courtesy and kindness.”
So he took the lute and sang these verses:—</p>

<div class="lg-container-b c003">
  <div class="linegroup">
    <div class="group">
      <div class="line">To our beloveds we moaned our length of night; ✿ Quoth they, “How short the nights that us benight!”</div>
      <div class="line">‘Tis for that sleep like hood enveils <em>their</em> eyes ✿ Right soon, but from <em>our</em> eyes is fair of flight:</div>
      <div class="line">When night falls, dread and drear to those who love, ✿ <em>We</em> mourn; <em>they</em> joy to see departing light:</div>
      <div class="line">Had they but dree’d the weird, the bitter dole ✿ We dree, their beds like ours had bred them blight.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class="c000">(Quoth Ibrahim), So I said to him, “By Allah, thou hast shown
me a kindness, O my friend, and hast done away from me the
pangs of sorrow. Let me hear more trifles of thy fashion.” So
he sang these couplets:—</p>

<div class="lg-container-b c003">
  <div class="linegroup">
    <div class="group">
      <div class="line">When man keeps honour bright without a stain, ✿ Fair sits whatever robe to robe he’s fain!</div>
      <div class="line">She jeered at me because so few we are; ✿ Quoth I:—“There’s ever dearth of noble men!”</div>
      <div class="line">Naught irks us we are few, while neighbour tribes ✿ Count many; neighbours oft are base-born strain:</div>
      <div class="line">We are a clan which holds not Death reproach, ✿ Which A’mir and Samúl<a id="r151"></a><a href="#f151" class="c014"><sup>[151]</sup></a> hold illest bane:</div>
      <div class="line">Leads us our love of death to fated end; ✿ They hate that ending and delay would gain:</div>
      <div class="line">We to our neighbours’ speech aye give the lie; ✿ But when we speak none dare give lie again.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class="c000">(Quoth Ibrahim), When I heard these lines, I was filled with huge
delight and marvelled with exceeding marvel. Then I slept and
awoke not till past nightfall, when I washed my face, with a mind full
of the high worth of this barber-surgeon and his passing courtesy;
after which I wakened him and, taking out a purse I had by me
containing a number of gold pieces, threw it to him, saying, “I
commend thee to Allah, for I am about to go forth from thee, and
pray thee to expend what is in this purse on thine requirements;
<span class="pageno" id="Page_107">107</span>and thou shalt have an abounding reward of me, when I am quit
of my fear.” (Quoth Ibrahim), But he returned the bag to me,
saying, “O my lord, paupers like myself are of no value in thine
eyes; but how, with due respect to my own generosity, can I take
a price for the boon which fortune hath vouchsafed me of thy
favour and thy visit to my poor abode? Nay, if thou repeat thy
words and throw the purse to me again I will slay myself.” So I
put in my sleeve<a id="r152"></a><a href="#f152" class="c014"><sup>[152]</sup></a> the purse whose weight was irksome to me.——And
Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her
permitted say.</p>

<div>

<div class="nf-center-c1">
<div class="nf-center c005">
    <div>Now when it was the Two Hundred and Seventy-fourth Night,</div>
  </div>
</div>

</div>

<p class="c000">She said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that Ibrahim
son of Al-Mahdi continued:—So I put in my sleeve the purse
whose weight was irksome to me; and turned to depart, but when
I came to the house-door he said, “O my lord, of a truth this is
a safer hiding-place for thee than any other, and thy keep is no
burden to me; so do thou abide with me, till Allah be pleased to<a id="p107"></a>
grant thee relief.” Accordingly, I turned back, saying, “On condition
that thou spend of the money in this purse.” He made me
think that he consented to this arrangement, and I abode with
him some days in the utmost comfort; but, perceiving that he
spent none of the contents of the purse, I revolted at the idea of
abiding at his charge and thought it shame to be a burthen on
him; so I left the house disguised in women’s apparel, donning
short yellow walking-boots<a id="r153"></a><a href="#f153" class="c014"><sup>[153]</sup></a> and veil. Now as soon as I found
myself in the street, I was seized with excessive fear, and going to
pass the bridge behold, I came to a place sprinkled with water,<a id="r154"></a><a href="#f154" class="c014"><sup>[154]</sup></a>
<span class="pageno" id="Page_108">108</span>where a trooper, who had been in my service, looked at me and
knowing me, cried out, saying, “This is he whom Al-Maamun
wanteth.” Then he laid hold of me but the love of sweet life lent
me strength and I gave him and his horse a push which threw
them down in that slippery place, so that he became an example
to those who will take example; and the folk hastened to him.
Meanwhile, I hurried my pace over the bridge and entered a main
street, where I saw the door of a house open and a woman standing
upon the threshold. So I said to her, “O my lady, have pity
on me and save my life; for I am a man in fear.” Quoth she,
“Enter and welcome;” and carried me into an upper dining-room,
where she spread me a bed and brought me food, saying,
“Calm thy fear, for not a soul shall know of thee.” As she spoke,
lo! there came a loud knocking at the door; so she went and
opened, and suddenly, my friend, whom I had thrown down on the
bridge, appeared with his head bound up, the blood running down
upon his clothes and without his horse. She asked, “O so and so,
what accident hath befallen thee?”; and he answered, “I made
prize of the young man whom the Caliph seeketh and he escaped
from me;” whereupon he told her the whole story. So she
brought out tinder<a id="r155"></a><a href="#f155" class="c014"><sup>[155]</sup></a> and, putting it into a piece of rag bandaged
his head; after which she spread him a bed and he lay sick. Then
she came up to me and said, “Methinks thou art the man in
question?” “Even so,” answered I, and she said, “Fear not: no
harm shall befal thee,” and redoubled in kindness to me. So I
tarried with her three days, at the end of which time she said
to me, “I am in fear for thee, lest yonder man happen upon thee
and betray thee to what thou dreadest; so save thyself by flight.”
I besought her to let me stay till nightfall, and she said, “There is
no harm in that.” So, when the night came, I put on my woman’s
gear and betook me to the house of a freed-woman who had once
been our slave. When she saw me she wept and made a show of
affliction and praised Almighty Allah for my safety. Then she
went forth, as if she would go to market intent on hospitable
thoughts, and I fancied all was right; but, ere long, suddenly
I espied Ibrahim al-Mosili<a id="r156"></a><a href="#f156" class="c014"><sup>[156]</sup></a> making for the house amongst his
troopers and servants, and led by a woman on foot; and looking
<span class="pageno" id="Page_109">109</span>narrowly at her behold, she was the freed-woman, the mistress
of the house, wherein I had taken refuge. So she delivered me
into their hands, and I saw death face to face. They carried me,
in my woman’s attire, to Al-Maamun who called a general council
and had me brought before him. When I entered I saluted him
by the title of Caliph, saying, “Peace be on thee, O Commander of
the Faithful!” and he replied, “Allah give thee neither peace nor
long life.” I rejoined, “According to thy good pleasure, O Commander
of the Faithful!; it is for the claimant of blood-revenge<a id="r157"></a><a href="#f157" class="c014"><sup>[157]</sup></a>
to decree punishment or pardon; but mercy is nigher to piety;
and Allah hath set thy pardon above all other pardon, even as
He made my sin to excel all other sin. So, if thou punish, it is
of thine equity, and if thou pardon, it is of thy bounty.” And
I repeated these couplets:—</p>

<div class="lg-container-b c003">
  <div class="linegroup">
    <div class="group">
      <div class="line">My sin to thee is great, ✿ But greater thy degree:</div>

      <div class="line">An I in deeds have not ✿ Been generous, generous be!</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class="c000">(Quoth Ibrahim), At this Al-Maamun raised his head to me an
I hastened to add these two couplets:—</p>

<div class="lg-container-b c003">
  <div class="linegroup">
    <div class="group">
      <div class="line">I’ve sinned enormous sin, ✿ But pardon in thee lies:</div>

my woman’s veil from my head and cried out, with my loudest
voice, “Allah is Most Great! By Allah, the Commander of the
Faithful pardoneth me!” Quoth he, “No harm shall come to
thee, O uncle;” and I rejoined, “O Commander of the Faithful,
my sin is too sore for me to excuse it and thy mercy is too much
for me to speak thanks for it.” And I chanted these couplets to
a lively motive:—</p>

<div class="lg-container-b c003">

<p class="c000">Quoth Maamun, “I say, following our lord Joseph (on whom and

cast on you this day. Allah forgiveth you; for He is the most
merciful of those who show mercy.<a id="r163"></a><a href="#f163" class="c014"><sup>[163]</sup></a> Indeed I pardon thee, and
restore to thee thy goods and lands, O uncle, and no harm shall
befal thee.” So I offered up devout prayers for him and repeated
these couplets:—</p>

<div class="lg-container-b c003">
  <div class="linegroup">
    <div class="group">
      <div class="line">Thou hast restored my wealth sans greed, and ere ✿ So didst, thou deignèdest my blood to spare:</div>

</div>

<p class="c000">Then Al-Maamun showed me honour and favour and said to me,
<span class="pageno" id="Page_112">112</span>“O uncle, Abu Ishak and Al-Abbas counselled me to put thee to
death.” So I answered, “And they both counselled thee right,
O Commander of the Faithful, but thou hast done after thine own
nature and hast put away what I feared with what I hoped.” Rejoined
Al-Maamun, “O uncle, thou didst extinguish my rancour
with the modesty of thine excuse, and I have pardoned thee without
making thee drink the bitterness of obligation to intercessors.”
Then he prostrated himself in prayer a long while, after which he
raised his head and said to me, “O uncle, knowest thou why I
prostrated myself?” Answered I, “Haply thou didst this in
thanksgiving to Allah, for that He hath given thee the mastery
over thine enemy.” He replied, “Such was not my design, but
rather to thank Allah for having inspired me to pardon thee and
for having cleared my mind towards thee. Now tell me thy tale.”
So I told him all that had befallen me with the barber, the trooper
and his wife and with my freed-woman who had betrayed me. So
he summoned the freed-woman, who was in her house, expecting the
reward to be sent for her, and when she came before him he said
to her, “What moved thee to deal thus with thy lord?” Quoth
she, “Lust of money.” Asked the Caliph. “Hast thou a child or
a husband?”; and she answered “No;” whereupon he bade them
give her an hundred stripes with a whip and imprisoned her for
life. Then he sent for the trooper and his wife and the barber-surgeon
and asked the soldier what had moved him to do thus.
“Lust of money,” quoth he; whereupon quoth the Caliph, “It
befitteth thee to be a barber-cupper,”<a id="r164"></a><a href="#f164" class="c014"><sup>[164]</sup></a> and committed him to one
whom he charged to place him in a barber-cupper’s shop, where
he might learn the craft. But he showed honour to the trooper’s
wife and lodged her in his palace, saying, “This is a woman of
sound sense and fit for matters of moment.” Then said he to the
barber-cupper, “Verily, thou hast shown worth and generosity
which call for extraordinary honour.” So he commanded the
trooper’s house and all that was therein to be given him and
bestowed on him a dress of honour and in addition fifteen thousand
dinars to be paid annually. And men tell the following tale

in the deserts of Al-Yaman and the district of Sabá,<a id="r166"></a><a href="#f166" class="c014"><sup>[166]</sup></a>
behold, he came upon a great city girt by a vast castle around
which were palaces and pavilions that rose high into middle air.
He made for the place thinking to find there folk of whom he
might ask concerning his she-camel; but, when he reached it, he
found it desolate, without a living soul in it. So (quoth he) I
alighted and, hobbling my dromedary,——And Shahrazad perceived

bin Abi Kilabah continued:—I dismounted and hobbling my dromedary,
and composing my mind, entered into the city. Now when
<span class="pageno" id="Page_114">114</span>I came to the castle, I found it had two vast gates (never in the
world was seen their like for size and height) inlaid with all
manner jewels and jacinths, white and red, yellow and green.
Beholding this I marvelled with great marvel and thought the
case mighty wondrous; then entering the citadel in a flutter of
fear and dazed with surprise and affright, I found it long and
wide about equalling Al-Medinah<a id="r167"></a><a href="#f167" class="c014"><sup>[167]</sup></a> in point of size; and therein
were lofty palaces laid out in pavilions all built of gold and silver
and inlaid with many-coloured jewels and jacinths and chrysolites
and pearls. And the door-leaves in the pavilions were like those
of the castle for beauty; and their floors were strewn with great
pearls and balls, no smaller than hazel-nuts, of musk and ambergris
and saffron. Now when I came within the heart of the city
and saw therein no created beings of the Sons of Adam I was near
swooning and dying for fear. Moreover, I looked down from the
great roofs of the pavilion-chambers and their balconies and saw
rivers running under them; and in the main streets were fruit-laden
trees and tall palms; and the manner of their building was
one brick of gold and one of silver. So I said in myself, “Doubtless
this is the Paradise promised for the world to come.” Then I
loaded me with the jewels of its gravel and the musk of its dust as
much as I could carry and returned to my own country, where I
told the folk what I had seen. After a time the news reached
Mu’áwiyah, son of Abu Sufyán, who was then Caliph in Al-Hijaz;
so he wrote to his lieutenant in San’á of Al-Yaman to send for
the teller of the story and question him of the truth of the case.
Accordingly the lieutenant summoned me and questioned me of
my adventure and of all appertaining to it; and I told him what
I had seen, whereupon he despatched me to Mu’awiyah, before
whom I repeated the story of the strange sights; but he would
not credit it. So I brought out to him some of the pearls and
balls of musk and ambergris and saffron, in which latter there was
still some sweet savour; but the pearls were grown yellow and had
lost pearly colour.——And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day

<p class="c000">She said, it hath reached me, O auspicious King, that Abdullah
son of Abu Kilabah continued:—But the pearls were grown yellow
and had lost pearly colour. Now Mu’awiyah wondered at this and,
sending for Ka’ab al-Ahbar<a id="r168"></a><a href="#f168" class="c014"><sup>[168]</sup></a> said to him, “O Ka’ab, I have sent for
thee to ascertain the truth of a certain matter and hope that thou
wilt be able to certify me thereof.” Asked Ka’ab, “What is
it, O Commander of the Faithful?”; and Mu’awiyah answered,
“Wottest thou of any city founded by man which is builded of gold
and silver, the pillars whereof are of chrysolite and rubies and its
gravel pearls and balls of musk and ambergris and saffron?” He
replied, “Yes, O Commander of the Faithful, this is ‘Iram with
pillars decked and dight, the like of which was never made in the
lands,’<a id="r169"></a><a href="#f169" class="c014"><sup>[169]</sup></a> and the builder was Shaddad son of Ad the Greater.”
Quoth the Caliph, “Tell us something of its history,” and Ka’ab
said:—Ad the Greater had two sons, Shadíd and Shaddád who,
when their father died, ruled conjointly in his stead, and there was
no King of the Kings of the earth but was subject to them. After
awhile Shadid died and his brother Shaddad reigned over the
earth alone. Now he was fond of reading in antique books; and,
happening upon the description of the world to come and of
Paradise, with its pavilions and galleries and trees and fruits and
so forth, his soul moved him to build the like thereof in this world,
after the fashion aforesaid. Now under his hand were an hundred
thousand Kings, each ruling over an hundred thousand chiefs.<a id="r170"></a><a href="#f170" class="c014"><sup>[170]</sup></a><a id="p115"></a>
<span class="pageno" id="Page_116">116</span>commanding each an hundred thousand warriors; so he called
these all before him and said to them, “I find in ancient books
and annals a description of Paradise, as it is to be in the next
world, and I desire to build me its like in this world. Go ye forth
therefore to the goodliest tract on earth and the most spacious
and build me there a city of gold and silver, whose gravel shall be
chrysolite and rubies and pearls; and for support of its vaults
make pillars of jasper. Fill it with palaces, whereon ye shall set
galleries and balconies and plant its lanes and thoroughfares with
all manner trees bearing yellow-ripe fruits and make rivers to run
through it in channels of gold and silver.” Whereat said one and
all, “How are we able to do this thing thou hast commanded, and
whence shall we get the chrysolites and rubies and pearls whereof
thou speakest?” Quoth he, “What! weet ye not that the Kings
of the world are subject to me and under my hand and that none
therein dare gainsay my word?” Answered they, “Yes, we know
that.”——And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased
to say her permitted say.</p>

<p class="c000">She said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that the lieges
answered, “Yes, we know that;” whereupon the King rejoined,
“Fare ye then to the mines of chrysolites and rubies and pearls
and gold and silver and collect their produce and gather together
all of value that is in the world and spare no pains and leave
naught; and take also for me such of these things as be in men’s
hands and let nothing escape you: be diligent and beware of
disobedience.” And thereupon he wrote letters to all the Kings of
the world and bade them gather together whatso of these things
was in their subjects’ hands, and get them to the mines of precious
stones and metals, and bring forth all that was therein, even from
the abysses of the seas. This they accomplished in the space of
20 years, for the number of rulers then reigning over the earth was
three hundred and sixty Kings; and Shaddad presently assembled
from all lands and countries architects and engineers and men of art
and labourers and handicraftsmen, who dispersed over the world
and explored all the wastes and wolds and tracts and holds. At
last they came to an uninhabited spot, a vast and fair open plain
clear of sand-hills and mountains, with founts flushing and rivers
<span class="pageno" id="Page_117">117</span>rushing, and they said, “This is the manner of place the King
commanded us to seek and ordered us to find.” So they busied
themselves in building the city even as bade them Shaddad, King
of the whole earth in its length and breadth; leading the fountains
in channels and laying the foundations after the prescribed fashion.
Moreover, all the Kings of earth’s several reigns sent thither
jewels and precious stones and pearls large and small and carnelian
and refined gold and virgin silver upon camels by land, and in
great ships over the waters, and there came to the builders’ hands
of all these materials so great a quantity as may neither be told
nor counted nor conceived. So they laboured at the work three
hundred years; and, when they had brought it to end, they went
to King Shaddad and acquainted him therewith. Then said he,
“Depart and make thereon an impregnable castle, rising and
towering high in air, and build around it a thousand pavilions, each
upon a thousand columns of chrysolite and ruby and vaulted with
gold, that in each pavilion a Wazir may dwell.” So they returned
forthwith and did this in other twenty years; after which they
again presented themselves before King Shaddad and informed
him of the accomplishment of his will. Then he commanded his
Wazirs, who were a thousand in number, and his Chief Officers and
such of his troops and others as he put trust in, to prepare for
departure and removal to Many-columned Iram, in the suite and
at the stirrup of Shaddad, son of Ad, King of the world; and he
bade also such as he would of his women and his Harim and of
his handmaids and eunuchs make them ready for the journey.
They spent twenty years in preparing for departure, at the end
of which time Shaddad set out with his host.——And Shahrazad

bin Ad fared forth, he and his host, rejoicing in the attainment of
his desire till there remained but one day’s journey between him
and Iram of the Pillars. Then Allah sent down on him and on
the stubborn unbelievers with him a mighty rushing sound from
the Heavens of His power, which destroyed them all with its
vehement clamour, and neither Shaddad nor any of his company
<span class="pageno" id="Page_118">118</span>set eyes on the city.<a id="r171"></a><a href="#f171" class="c014"><sup>[171]</sup></a> Moreover, Allah blotted out the road which
led to the city, and it stands in its stead unchanged until the

“Hath any mortal ever made his way to that city?” He replied,
“Yes; one of the companions of Mohammed (on whom be blessing

fashion as this man here seated.” And (quoth Al-Sha’abi<a id="r172"></a><a href="#f172" class="c014"><sup>[172]</sup></a>) it is

from the desert to Hazramaut and bade them hew him out a tomb

over the corpse threescore and ten robes of cloth of gold, purfled
with precious stones. Lastly at his sire’s head he set up a tablet
of gold whereon were graven these verses:—</p>

<p class="c000"><span class="label"><a href="#r165">165</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>The Bresl. Edit. (vii. 171-174) entitles this tale, “Story of Shaddád bin Ad and the
City of Iram the Columned;” but it relates chiefly the building by the King of the
First Adites who, being promised a future Paradise by Prophet Húd, impiously said that
he would lay out one in this world. It also quotes Ka’ab al-Ahbár as an authority for
declaring that the tale is in the “Pentateuch of Moses.” Iram was in al-Yaman near
Adan (our Aden) a square of ten parasangs (or leagues each = 18,000 feet) every way; the
walls were of red (baked) brick 500 cubits high and 20 broad, with four gates of corresponding
grandeur. It contained 300,000 Kasr (palaces) each with a thousand pillars of
gold-bound jasper, etc. (whence its title). The whole was finished in five hundred years;
and, when Shaddad prepared to enter it, the “Cry of Wrath” from the Angel of Death
slew him and all his many. It is mentioned in the Koran (chapt. lxxxix. 6-7) as “Irem
adorned with lofty buildings (or pillars).” But Ibn Khaldun declares that commentators
have embroidered the passage; Iram being the name of a powerful clan of the
ancient Adites and “imád” being a tent-pole: hence “Iram with the numerous tents
or tent-poles.” Al-Bayzawi tells the story of Abdullah ibn Kilabah (D’Herbelot’s
Colabah). At Aden I met an Arab who had seen the mysterious city on the borders of
Al-Ahkáf, the waste of deep sands, west of Hadramaut; and probably he had, the
mirage or sun-reek taking its place. Compare with this tale “The City of Brass”

  <h2 id="c119" class="c007">ISAAC OF MOSUL.</h2>
</div>

<p class="c013">Quoth Isaac of Mosul:<a id="r175"></a><a href="#f175" class="c014"><sup>[175]</sup></a>—I went out one night from Al-Maamun’s
presence, on my way to my house; and, being taken with a
pressing need to make water, I turned aside into a by-street and
stood in the middle fearing lest something might hurt me, if I
squatted against a wall.<a id="r176"></a><a href="#f176" class="c014"><sup>[176]</sup></a> Presently, I espied something hanging
down from one of the houses; so I felt it to find out what it might
be and found that it was a great four-handled basket,<a id="r177"></a><a href="#f177" class="c014"><sup>[177]</sup></a> covered with
brocade. Said I to myself, “There must be some reason for this,”
and knew not what to think; then drunkenness led me to seat
myself in the basket, and behold, the people of the house pulled
me up, thinking me to be the person they expected. Now when
I came to the top of the wall; lo! four damsels were there, who
said to me, “Descend and welcome and joy to thee!” Then one
of them went before me with a wax candle and brought me down
into a mansion, wherein were furnished sitting-chambers, whose
like I had never seen save in the palace of the Caliphate. So I
sat down and after a while, the curtains were suddenly drawn from
one side of the room and, behold, in came damsels walking in procession
<span class="pageno" id="Page_120">120</span>and hending in hand lighted flambeaux of wax and censers
full of Sumatran aloes-wood, and amongst them a young lady as
she were the rising full moon. So I stood up to her and she
said, “Welcome to thee for a visitor!” and then she made me
sit down again and asked me how I came thither. Quoth I, “I
was returning home from the house of an intimate friend and went
astray in the dark; then, being taken in the street with an urgent
call to make water, I turned aside into this lane, where I found a
basket let down. The strong wine which I had drunk led me to
seat myself in it and it was drawn up with me into this house, and
this is my story.” She rejoined, “No harm shall befal thee, and I
hope thou wilt have cause to praise the issue of thine adventure.”
Then she added, “But what is thy condition?” I said,
“A merchant in the Baghdad bazar” and she, “Canst thou
repeat any verses?” “Some small matter,” quoth I. Quoth she
“Then call a few to mind and let us hear some of them.” But
I said, “A visitor is bashful and timid; do thou begin.” “True,”
replied she and recited some verses of the poets, past and present,
choosing their choicest pieces; and I listened not knowing whether
more to marvel at her beauty and loveliness or at the charm of her
style of declamation. Then said she, “Is that bashfulness of
thine gone?” and I said, “Yes, by Allah!” so she rejoined,
“Then, if thou wilt, recite us somewhat.” So I repeated to her a
number of poems by old writers, and she applauded, saying, “By
Allah, I did not think to find such culture among the trade folk,
the sons of the bazar!” Then she called for food——Whereupon
quoth Shahrazad’s sister Dunyazad, “How pleasant is this tale
and enjoyable and sweet to the ear and sound to the sense!” But
she answered, “And what is this story compared with that which
thou shalt hear on the morrow’s night, if I be alive and the King
deign spare me!” Then Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day
and ceased saying her permitted say.</p>

    <div>Now when it was the Two Hundred and Eightieth Night,</div>
  </div>
</div>

</div>

<p class="c000">She said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that Isaac of
Mosul continued:—Then the damsel called for food and, when it
was served to her, she fell to eating it and setting it before me;
and the sitting-room was full of all manner sweet-scented flowers
and rare fruits, such as are never found save in Kings’ houses.
<span class="pageno" id="Page_121">121</span>Presently, she called for wine and drank a cup, after which she
filled another and gave it to me, saying, “Now is the time for
converse and story-telling.” So I bethought myself and began
to say, “It hath reached me that such and such things happened;
and there was a man who said so and so,” till I had told her a
number of pleasing tales and adventures with which she was
delighted and cried, “’Tis marvellous that a merchant should
bear in memory such store of stories like these, for they are fit
for Kings.” Quoth I, “I had a neighbour who used to consort
with Kings and carouse with them; so, when he was at leisure,
I visited his house and he hath often told me what thou hast
heard.” Thereupon she exclaimed “By my life, but thou hast
a good memory!” So we continued to converse thus, and as
often as I was silent, she would begin, till in this way we passed
the most part of the night, whilst the burning aloes-wood diffused
its fragrance and I was in such case that if Al-Maamun had
suspected it, he would have flown like a bird with longing for
it. Then said she to me, “Verily, thou art one of the most
pleasant of men, polished, passing well bred and polite; but there
lacketh one thing.” “What is that?” asked I, and she answered,
“If thou only knew how to sing verses to the lute!” I
answered, “I was passionately fond of this art aforetime, but
finding I had no taste for it, I abandoned it, though at times
my heart yearneth after it. Indeed, I should love to sing somewhat
well at this moment and fulfil my night’s enjoyment.”
Then she, “Meseemeth thou hintest a wish for the lute to be
brought?” and I, “It is thine to decide, if thou wilt so far
favour me, and to thee be the thanks.” So she called for a lute
and sang a song in a voice whose like I never heard, both for
sweetness of tone and skill in playing, and perfection of art. Then
said she, “Knowest thou who composed this air and whose
are the words of this song?” “No,” answered I; and she said,
“The words are so and so’s and the air is Isaac’s.” I asked,
“And hath Isaac then (may I be thy sacrifice!) such a talent?”
She replied, “Bravo!<a id="r178"></a><a href="#f178" class="c014"><sup>[178]</sup></a> Bravo, Isaac! indeed, he excelleth in this
art.” I rejoined, “Glory be to Allah who hath given this man
what he hath vouchsafed unto none other!” Then she said,
“And how would it be, an thou heard this song from himself?”
<span class="pageno" id="Page_122">122</span>This wise we went on till break of day-dawn, when there came to
her an old woman, as she were her nurse, and said to her, “Verily,
the time is come.” So she rose in haste and said to me, “Keep
what hath passed between us to thyself; for such meetings are in
confidence;”——And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and
ceased saying her permitted say.</p>

<div class="nf-center c005">
    <div>Now when it was the Two Hundred and Eighty-first Night,</div>
  </div>
</div>

</div>

<p class="c000">She said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that the damsel
whispered, “Keep what hath passed between us to thyself, for
such meetings are in confidence;” and I replied, “May I be thy
ransom! I needed no charge to this.” Then I took leave of her
and she sent a handmaid to show me the way and open the house
door; so I went forth and returned to my own place, where I
prayed the morning prayer and slept. Now after a time there
came to me a messenger from Al-Maamun, so I went to him and
passed the day in his company. And when the night fell I called
to mind my yesternight’s pleasure, a thing from which none but
an ignoramus would abstain, and betook myself to the street,
where I found the basket, and seating myself therein, was drawn
up to the place in which I had passed the previous night. When
the lady saw me, she said, “Indeed, thou hast been assiduous;”
and I answered, “Meseemeth rather that I am neglectful.” Then
we fell to discoursing and passed the night as before in general
conversation and reciting verses and telling rare tales, each in
turn, till daybreak, when I wended me home; and I prayed the
dawn-prayer and slept. Presently there came to me a messenger
from Al-Maamun; so I went to him and spent my day
with him till nightfall, when the Commander of the Faithful said
to me, “I conjure thee to sit here, whilst I go out for a want and
come back.” As soon as the Caliph was gone, and quite gone,
my thoughts began to tempt and try me and, calling to mind my
late delight, I recked little what might befal me from the Prince
of True Believers. So I sprang up and turning my back upon the
sitting-room, ran to the street aforesaid, where I sat down in the
basket and was drawn up as before. When the lady saw me, she
said, “I begin to think thou art a sincere friend to us.” Quoth I,
“Yea, by Allah!” and quoth she, “Hast thou made our house
thine abiding-place?” I replied, “May I be thy ransom! A
<span class="pageno" id="Page_123">123</span>guest claimeth guest-right for three days and if I return after
this, ye are free to spill my blood.” Then we passed the night as
before; and when the time of departure drew near, I bethought
me that Al-Maamun would assuredly question me nor would ever
be content save with a full explanation: so I said to her, “I see
thee to be of those who delight in singing. Now I have a cousin,
the son of my father’s brother, who is fairer than I in face and
higher of rank and better of breeding; and he is the most intimate
of Allah’s creatures with Isaac.” Quoth she, “Art thou a parasite<a id="r179"></a><a href="#f179" class="c014"><sup>[179]</sup></a>
and an importunate one?” Quoth I, “It is for thee to decide
in this matter;” and she, “If thy cousin be as thou hast described
him, it would not mislike us to make acquaintance with him.”
Then, as the time was come, I left her and returned to my house,
but hardly had I reached it, ere the Caliph’s runners came down
on me and carried me before him by main force and roughly
enough.——And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased
to say her permitted say.</p>

<div>

<div class="nf-center-c1">
<div class="nf-center c005">
    <div>Now when it was the Two Hundred and Eighty-second Night,</div>
  </div>
</div>

</div>

<p class="c000">She said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that Isaac of
Mosul continued:—And hardly had I reached my house ere the
Caliph’s runners came down upon me and carried me before him
by main force and roughly enough. I found him seated on a
chair, wroth with me, and he said to me, “O Isaac, art thou a
traitor to thine allegiance?” replied I, “No, by Allah, O Commander
of the Faithful!” and he rejoined, “What hast thou then
to say? tell me the whole truth;” and I, “Yes, I will, but in
private.” So he signed to his attendants, who withdrew to a
distance, and I told him the case, adding, “I promised her to
bring thee,” and he said, “Thou didst well.” Then we spent the
day in our usual pleasures, but Al-Maamun’s heart was taken up
with her, and hardly was the appointed time come, when we set
out. As we went along, I cautioned him, saying, “Look that thou
call me not by my name before her; and I will demean myself
<span class="pageno" id="Page_124">124</span>like thine attendant.” And having agreed upon this, we fared
forth till we came to the place, where we found two baskets hanging
ready. So we sat down in them and were drawn up to the
usual place, where the damsel came forward and saluted us. Now
when Al-Maamun saw her, he was amazed at her beauty and
loveliness; and she began to entertain him with stories and
verses. Presently, she called for wine and we fell to drinking,
she paying him special attention and he repaying her in kind.
Then she took the lute and sang these verses:—</p>

<div class="lg-container-b c003">
  <div class="linegroup">
    <div class="group">
      <div class="line">My lover came in at the close of night, ✿ I rose till he sat and remained upright;</div>
      <div class="line">And said “Sweet heart, hast thou come this hour? ✿ Nor feared on the watch and ward to ‘light:”</div>
      <div class="line">Quoth he “The lover <em>had</em> cause to fear, ✿ But Love deprived him of wits and fright.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class="c000">And when she ended her song she said to me, “And is thy cousin
also a merchant?” I answered, “Yes,” and she said, “Indeed, ye
resemble each other nearly.” But when Al-Maamun had drunk
three pints,<a id="r180"></a><a href="#f180" class="c014"><sup>[180]</sup></a> he grew merry with wine and called out, saying, “Ho,
Isaac!” And I replied, “Labbayk’, Adsum, O Commander of
the Faithful,” whereupon quoth he, “Sing me this air.” Now
when the young lady learned that he was the Caliph, she withdrew
to another place and disappeared; and, as I had made an
end of my song Al-Maamun said to me, “See who is the master
of this house”; whereupon an old woman hastened to make
answer, saying, “It belongs to Hasan bin Sahl.”<a id="r181"></a><a href="#f181" class="c014"><sup>[181]</sup></a> “Fetch him
to me,” said the Caliph. So she went away and after a while
behold, in came Hasan, to whom said Al-Maamun “Hast thou a
daughter?” He said, “Yes, and her name is Khadijah.” Asked
the Caliph, “Is she married?” Answered Hasan, “No, by Allah!”
Said Al-Maamun, “Then I ask her of thee in marriage.” Replied
her father, “O Commander of the Faithful, she is thy handmaid
<span class="pageno" id="Page_125">125</span>and at thy commandment.” Quoth Al-Maamun, “I take her to
wife at a present settlement of thirty thousand dinars, which thou
shalt receive this very morning; and, when the money has been
paid thee, do thou bring her to us this night.” And Hasan
answered, “I hear and I obey.” Thereupon we went forth and
the Caliph said to me, “O Isaac, tell this story to no one.” So I
kept it secret till Al-Maamun’s death. Surely never did man’s
life gather such pleasures as were mine these four days’ time,
whenas I companied with Al-Maamun by day and Khadijah by
night; and, by Allah, never saw I among men the like of Al-Maamun
nor among women have I ever set eyes on the like of
Khadijah; no, nor on any that came near her in lively wit and
pleasant speech! And Allah is All-knowing. But amongst stories
is that of</p>

<p class="c013">During the season of the Meccan pilgrimage, whilst the people
were making circuit about the Holy House and the place of
compassing was crowded, behold, a man laid hold of the covering
of the Ka’abah<a id="r182"></a><a href="#f182" class="c014"><sup>[182]</sup></a> and cried out, from the bottom of his heart,
saying, “I beseech thee, O Allah, that she may once again be
wroth with her husband and that I may know her!” A company
of the pilgrims heard him and seized him and carried him to the
Emir of the pilgrims, after a sufficiency of blows; and, said they,
“O Emir, we found this fellow in the Holy Places, saying thus and
thus.” So the Emir commanded to hang him; but he cried,
“O Emir, I conjure thee, by the virtue of the Apostle (whom
Allah bless and preserve!), hear my story and then do with me
as thou wilt.” Quoth the Emir, “Tell thy tale forthright.”
Know then, O Emir, quoth the man, that I am a sweep who
works in the sheep-slaughterhouses and carries off the blood and
the offal to the rubbish-heaps outside the gates. And it came to
<span class="pageno" id="Page_126">126</span>pass as I went along one day with my ass loaded, I saw the people
running away and one of them said to me, “Enter this alley, lest
haply they slay thee.” Quoth I, “What aileth the folk running
away?” and one of the eunuchs, who were passing, said to me,
“This is the Harim<a id="r183"></a><a href="#f183" class="c014"><sup>[183]</sup></a> of one of the notables and her eunuchs drive
the people out of her way and beat them all, without respect to
persons.” So I turned aside with the donkey——And Shahrazad
perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say.</p>

<div class="nf-center c005">
    <div>Now when it was the Two Hundred and Eighty-third Night,</div>
  </div>
</div>

</div>

<p class="c000">She said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that quoth the
man:—So I turned aside with the donkey and stood still awaiting
the dispersal of the crowd; and I saw a number of eunuchs with
staves in their hands, followed by nigh thirty women slaves, and
amongst them a lady as she were a willow-wand or a thirsty
gazelle, perfect in beauty and grace and amorous languor, and
all were attending upon her. Now when she came to the mouth
of the passage where I stood, she turned right and left and, calling
one of the Castratos, whispered in his ear; and behold, he came up
to me and laid hold of me, whilst another eunuch took my ass and
made off with it. And when the spectators fled, the first eunuch
bound me with a rope and dragged me after him till I knew not
what to do; and the people followed us and cried out, saying,
“This is not allowed of Allah! What hath this poor scavenger
done that he should be bound with ropes?” and praying the
eunuchs, “Have pity on him and let him go, so Allah have pity
on you!” And I the while said in my mind, “Doubtless the
eunuchry seized me, because their mistress smelt the stink of the
offal and it sickened her. Belike she is with child or ailing; but
there is no Majesty and there is no Might save in Allah, the
Glorious, the Great!” So I continued walking on behind them,
till they stopped at the door of a great house; and, entering
before me, brought me into a big hall—I know not how I shall
describe its magnificence—furnished with the finest furniture. And
the women also entered the hall; and I bound and held by the
eunuch and saying to myself, “Doubtless they will torture me
<span class="pageno" id="Page_127">127</span>here till I die and none know of my death.” However, after
a while, they carried me into a neat bath-room leading out of the
hall; and as I sat there, behold, in came three slave-girls who
seated themselves round me and said to me, “Strip off thy rags
and tatters.” So I pulled off my threadbare clothes and one of them
fell a-rubbing my legs and feet whilst another scrubbed my head
and a third shampooed my body. When they had made an end
of washing me, they brought me a parcel of clothes and said to
me, “Put these on”; and I answered, “By Allah, I know not
how!” So they came up to me and dressed me, laughing together
at me the while; after which they brought casting-bottles full of
rose-water, and sprinkled me therewith. Then I went out with
them into another saloon; by Allah, I know not how to praise its
splendour for the wealth of paintings and furniture therein; and
entering it, I saw a person seated on a couch of Indian rattan——And
Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her
permitted say.</p>

<div>

<div class="nf-center c005">
    <div>Now when it was the Two Hundred and Eighty-fourth Night,</div>
  </div>
</div>

</div>

<p class="c000">She said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that the sweep
continued:—When I entered that saloon I saw a person seated on
a couch of Indian rattan, with ivory feet and before her a number
of damsels. When she saw me she rose to me and called me; so
I went up to her and she seated me by her side. Then she bade
her slave-girls bring food, and they brought all manner of rich
meats, such as I never saw in all my life; I do not even know the
names of the dishes, much less their nature. So I ate my fill and
when the dishes had been taken away and we had washed our
hands, she called for fruits which came without stay or delay and
ordered me eat of them; and when we had ended eating she bade
one of the waiting-women bring the wine furniture. So they set
on flagons of divers kinds of wine and burned perfumes in all the
censers, what while a damsel like the moon rose and served us with
wine to the sound of the smitten strings; and I drank, and the
lady drank, till we were seized with wine and the whole time I
doubted not but that all this was an illusion of sleep. Presently,
she signed to one of the damsels to spread us a bed in such a
place, which being done, she rose and took me by the hand and
led me thither, and lay down and I lay with her till the morning,
and as often as I pressed her to my breast I smelt the delicious
<span class="pageno" id="Page_128">128</span>fragrance of musk and other perfumes that exhaled from her and
could not think otherwise but that I was in Paradise or in the vain
phantasies of a dream. Now when it was day, she asked me where
I lodged and I told her, “In such a place;” whereupon she gave
me leave to depart, handing to me a kerchief worked with gold
and silver and containing somewhat tied in it, and took leave of
me, saying, “Go to the bath with this.” I rejoiced and said to
myself, “If there be but five coppers here, it will buy me this day
my morning meal.” Then I left her, as though I were leaving
Paradise, and returned to my poor crib where I opened the kerchief
and found in it fifty miskals of gold. So I buried them in the
ground and, buying two farthings’ worth of bread and “kitchen,”<a id="r184"></a><a href="#f184" class="c014"><sup>[184]</sup></a>
seated me at the door and broke my fast; after which I sat pondering
my case and continued so doing till the time of afternoon-prayer,
when lo! a slave-girl accosted me saying, “My mistress
calleth for thee.” I followed her to the house aforesaid and, after
asking permission, she carried me into the lady, before whom I
kissed the ground, and she commanded me to sit and called for
meat and wine as on the previous day; after which I again lay
with her all night. On the morrow, she gave me a second kerchief,
with other fifty dinars therein, and I took it and going home,
buried this also. In such pleasant condition I continued eight
days running, going in to her at the hour of afternoon-prayer and
leaving her at daybreak; but, on the eighth night, as I lay with
her, behold, one of her slave-girls came running in and said to me,
“Arise, go up into yonder closet.” So I rose and went into the
closet, which was over the gate, and presently I heard a great
clamour and tramp of horse; and, looking out of the window
which gave on the street in front of the house, I saw a young man
as he were the rising moon on the night of fulness come riding up
attended by a number of servants and soldiers who were about
him on foot. He alighted at the door and entering the saloon
found the lady seated on the couch; so he kissed the ground between
her hands then came up to her and kissed her hands; but
she would not speak to him. However, he continued patiently to
humble himself, and soothe her and speak her fair, till he made his
peace with her, and they lay together that night.——And Shahrazad
perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted
say.</p>

  </div>
</div>

</div>

<p class="c000">She said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that the scavenger
continued:—Now when her husband had made his peace with the
young lady, he lay with her that night; and next morning, the
soldiers came for him and he mounted and rode away; whereupon
she drew near to me and said, “Sawst thou yonder man?” I
answered, “Yes;” and she said, “He is my husband, and I will
tell thee what befel me with him. It came to pass one day that
we were sitting, he and I, in the garden within the house, and
behold, he rose from my side and was absent a long while, till I
grew tired of waiting and said to myself:—Most like, he is in the
privy. So I arose and went to the water-closet, but not finding
him there, went down to the kitchen, where I saw a slave-girl;
and when I enquired for him, she showed him to me lying with
one of the cookmaids. Hereupon, I swore a great oath that I
assuredly would do adultery with the foulest and filthiest man in
Baghdad; and the day the eunuch laid hands on thee, I had been
four days going round about the city in quest of one who should
answer to this description, but found none fouler nor filthier than thy
good self. So I took thee and there passed between us that which
Allah fore-ordained to us; and now I am quit of my oath.” Then
she added, “If, however, my husband return yet again to the cookmaid
and lie with her, I will restore thee to thy lost place in my
favours.” Now when I heard these words from her lips, what
while she pierced my heart with the shafts of her glances, my tears
streamed forth, till my eyelids were chafed sore with weeping, and
I repeated the saying of the poet:—</p>

<div class="lg-container-b c003">

    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class="c000">Then she made them give me other fifty dinars (making in all four
hundred gold pieces I had of her) and bade me depart. So I went
<span class="pageno" id="Page_130">130</span>out from her and came hither, that I might pray Allah (extolled
and exalted be He!) to make her husband return to the cookmaid,
that haply I might be again admitted to her favours. When the
Emir of the pilgrims heard the man’s story, he set him free and
said to the bystanders, “Allah upon you, pray for him, for indeed
he is excusable.” And men also tell the tale of</p>

  <h2 id="c130" class="c007">THE MOCK CALIPH.</h2>
</div>

<p class="c013">It is related that the Caliph Harun al-Rashid, was one night restless
with extreme restlessness, so he summoned his Wazir Ja’afar
the Barmecide, and said to him, “My breast is straitened and I
have a desire to divert myself to-night by walking about the streets
of Baghdad and looking into folks’ affairs; but with this precaution
that we disguise ourselves in merchants’ gear, so none shall know
us.” He answered, “Hearkening and obedience.” They rose at once
and doffing the rich raiment they wore, donned merchants’ habits
and sallied forth three in number, the Caliph, Ja’afar and Masrur
the sworder. Then they walked from place to place, till they came
to the Tigris and saw an old man sitting in a boat; so they went
up to him and saluting him, said, “O Shaykh, we desire thee of thy
kindness and favour to carry us a-pleasuring down the river, in this
thy boat, and take this dinar to thy hire.”——And Shahrazad perceived
the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say.</p>

<div>

<div class="nf-center-c1">
<div class="nf-center c005">
    <div>Now when it was the Two Hundred and Eighty-sixth Night,</div>
  </div>
</div>

</div>

<p class="c000">She said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that when they
said to the old man, “We desire thee to carry us a-pleasuring in
this thy boat and take this dinar;” he answered, “Who may go
a-pleasuring on the Tigris? The Caliph Harun al-Rashid every
night cometh down Tigris-stream in his state-barge<a id="r186"></a><a href="#f186" class="c014"><sup>[186]</sup></a> and with him
one crying aloud:—Ho, ye people all, great and small, gentle and
simple, men and boys, whoso is found in a boat on the Tigris by
night, I will strike off his head or hang him to the mast of his craft!
<span class="pageno" id="Page_131">131</span>And ye had well nigh met him; for here cometh his carrack.”
But the Caliph and Ja’afar said, “O Shaykh, take these two
dinars, and run us under one of yonder arches, that we may hide
there till the Caliph’s barge have passed.” The old man replied,
“Hand over your gold and rely we on Allah, the Almighty!” So
he took the two dinars and embarked them in the boat; and he
put off and rowed about with them awhile, when behold, the barge
came down the river in mid-stream, with lighted flambeaux and
cressets flaming therein. Quoth the old man, “Did not I tell you
that the Caliph passed along the river every night?”; and ceased
not muttering, “O Protector, remove not the veils of Thy protection!”
Then he ran the boat under an arch and threw a piece
of black cloth over the Caliph and his companions, who looked
out from under the covering and saw, in the bows of the barge,
a man holding in hand a cresset of red gold which he fed with
Sumatran lign-aloes and the figure was clad in a robe of red satin,
with a narrow turband of Mosul shape round on his head; and
over one of his shoulders hung a sleeved cloak<a id="r187"></a><a href="#f187" class="c014"><sup>[187]</sup></a> of cramoisy
satin, and on the other was a green silk bag full of the aloes-wood,
with which he fed the cresset by way of fire-wood. And
they sighted in the stern another man, clad like the first and
bearing a like cresset, and in the barge were two hundred white
slaves, standing ranged to the right and left; and in the middle
a throne of red gold, whereon sat a handsome young man, like the
moon, clad in a dress of black, embroidered with yellow gold.
Before him they beheld a man, as he were the Wazir Ja’afar, and
at his head stood an eunuch, as he were Masrur, with a drawn
sword in his hand; besides a score of cup-companions. Now
when the Caliph saw this, he turned and said, “O Ja’afar,” and the
Minister replied, “At thy service, O Prince of True Believers.”
Then quoth the Caliph, “Belike this is one of my sons, Al-Amin
or Al-Maamun.” Then he examined the young man who sat on the
throne and finding him perfect in beauty and loveliness and stature
and symmetric grace, said to Ja’afar, “Verily, this young man
abateth nor jot nor tittle of the state of the Caliphate! See, there
standeth before him one as he were thyself, O Ja’afar; yonder
eunuch who standeth at his head is as he were Masrur and those
courtiers as they were my own. By Allah, O Ja’afar, my reason is
<span class="pageno" id="Page_132">132</span>confounded and I am filled with amazement at this matter!”——And
Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say
her permitted say.</p>

<div class="nf-center c005">
    <div>Now when it was the Two Hundred and Eighty-seventh Night,</div>
  </div>
</div>

</div>

<p class="c000">She said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that when the
Caliph saw this spectacle his reason was confounded and he cried,
“By Allah, I am filled with amazement at this matter!” and
Ja’afar replied, “And I also, by Allah, O Commander of the
Faithful.” Then the barge passed on and disappeared from sight;
whereupon the boatman pushed out again into the stream, saying,
“Praised be Allah for safety, since none hath fallen in with us!”
Quoth the Caliph, “O, old man, doth the Caliph come down the
Tigris-river every night?” The boatman answered, “Yes, O my
lord; and on such wise hath he done every night this year past.”
“O Shaykh,” rejoined Al-Rashid, “we wish thee of thy favour to
await us here to-morrow night and we will give thee five golden
dinars, for we are stranger folk, lodging in the quarter Al-Khandak,
and we have a mind to divert ourselves.” Said the
oldster, “With joy and good will!” Then the Caliph and Ja’afar
and Masrur left the boatman and returned to the palace, where
they doffed their merchants’ habits and, donning their apparel of
state, sat down each in his several stead; and came the Emirs and
Wazirs and Chamberlains and Officers; and the Divan assembled
and was crowded as of custom. But when day ended and all the
folk had dispersed and wended each his own way, the Caliph said
to his Wazir, “Rise, O Ja’afar, let us go and amuse ourselves by
looking on the second Caliph.” At this, Ja’afar and Masrur
laughed, and the three, donning merchants’ habits, went forth by
a secret postern and made their way through the city, in great
glee, till they came to the Tigris, where they found the greybeard
sitting and awaiting them. They embarked with him in the boat
and hardly had they sat down before up came the mock Caliph’s
barge; and, when they looked at it attentively, they saw therein
two hundred Mamelukes other than those of the previous night,
while the link-bearers cried aloud as of wont. Quoth the Caliph,
“O Wazir, had I heard tell of this, I had not believed it; but I
have seen it with my own sight.” Then said he to the boatman,
“Take, O Shaykh, these ten dinars and row us along abreast of
<span class="pageno" id="Page_133">133</span>them, for they are in the light and we in the shade, and we can
see them and amuse ourselves by looking on them, but they
cannot see us.” So the man took the money and pushing off ran
abreast of them in the shadow of the barge——And Shahrazad
perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say.</p>

<div>

<div class="nf-center-c1">
<div class="nf-center c005">
    <div>Now when it was the Two Hundred and Eighty-eighth Night,</div>
  </div>
</div>

</div>

<p class="c000">She said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King that the Caliph
Harun al-Rashid said to the old man, “Take these ten dinars and
row us abreast of them;” to which he replied, “I hear and I
obey.” And he fared with them and ceased not going in the
blackness of the barge, till they came amongst the gardens that
lay alongside of them and sighted a large walled enclosure; and
presently, the barge cast anchor before a postern door, where they
saw servants standing with a she-mule saddled and bridled. Here
the mock Caliph landed and, mounting the mule, rode away with
his courtiers and his cup-companions preceded by the cresset-bearers
crying aloud, and followed by his household which busied
itself in his service. Then Harun al-Rashid, Ja’afar and Masrur
landed also and, making their way through the press of servants,
walked on before them. Presently, the cresset-bearers espied them
and seeing three persons in merchants’ habits, and strangers to the
country, took offence at them; so they pointed them out and
brought them before the other Caliph, who looked at them and
asked, “How came ye to this place and who brought you at this
tide?” They answered, “O our lord, we are foreign merchants
and far from our homes, who arrived here this day and were out
a-walking to-night, and behold, ye came up and these men laid
hands on us and brought us to thy presence; and this is all our
story.” Quoth the mock Caliph, “Since ye be stranger folk no
harm shall befal you; but had ye been of Baghdad, I had struck
off your heads.” Then he turned to his Wazir and said to him,
“Take these men with thee; for they are our guests to-night.”
“To hear is to obey, O our lord,” answered he; and they
companied him till they came to a lofty and splendid palace set
upon the firmest base; no Sultan possesseth such a place; rising
from the dusty mould and upon the marges of the clouds laying
hold. Its door was of Indian teak-wood inlaid with gold that
glowed; and through it one passed into a royal-hall in whose
<span class="pageno" id="Page_134">134</span>midst was a jetting fount girt by a raised estrade. It was provided
with carpets and cushions of brocade and small pillows
and long settees and hanging curtains; it was furnished with a
splendour that dazed the mind and dumbed the tongue, and
upon the door were written these two couplets:—</p>

<div class="lg-container-b c003">
  <div class="linegroup">
    <div class="group">
      <div class="line">A Palace whereon be blessings and praise! ✿ Which with all their beauty have robed the Days:</div>
      <div class="line">Where marvels and miracle-sights abound, ✿ And to write its honours the pen affrays.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class="c000">The false Caliph entered with his company, and sat down on a
throne of gold set with jewels and covered with a prayer-carpet of
yellow silk; whilst the boon-companions took their seats and the
sword-bearer of high works stood before him. Then the tables
were laid and they ate; after which the dishes were removed and
they washed their hands and the wine-service was set on with
flagons and bowls in due order. The cup went round till it came
to the Caliph, Harun al-Rashid, who refused the draught and the
mock Caliph said to Ja’afar, “What mattereth thy friend that he
drinketh not?” He replied, “O my lord, indeed ‘tis a long while
he hath drunk naught of this.” Quoth the sham Caliph, “I have
drink other than this, a kind of apple-wine,<a id="r188"></a><a href="#f188" class="c014"><sup>[188]</sup></a> that will suit thy
companion.” So he bade them bring the cider which they did
forthright when the false Caliph, coming up to Harun al-Rashid,
said to him, “As often as it cometh to thy turn drink thou of this.”
Then they continued to drink and make merry and pass the cup
till the wine rose to their brains and mastered their wits;——And
Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her
permitted say.</p>

<div>

<div class="nf-center-c1">
<div class="nf-center c005">
    <div>Now when it was the Two Hundred and Eighty-ninth Night,</div>
  </div>
</div>

</div>

<p class="c000">She said, it hath reached me, O auspicious King, that the false
Caliph and his co-sitters sat at their cups and gave not over
drinking till the wine rose to their brains and mastered their wits;
and Harun al-Rashid said to the Minister, “O Ja’afar, by Allah,
we have no such vessels as these. Would to Heaven I knew what
manner of man this youth is!” But while they were talking
<span class="pageno" id="Page_135">135</span>privily the young man cast a glance upon them and seeing the
Wazir whisper the Caliph said, “’Tis rude to whisper.” He
replied, “No rudeness was meant: this my friend did but say
to me:—Verily I have travelled in most countries and have
caroused with the greatest of Kings and I have companied with
noble captains; yet never saw I a goodlier ordering than this
entertainment nor passed a more delightful night; save that the
people of Baghdad are wont to say, Wine without music often
leaves <em>you</em> sick.” When the second Caliph heard this, he smiled
pleasantly and struck with a rod he had in his hand a round gong;<a id="r189"></a><a href="#f189" class="c014"><sup>[189]</sup></a>
and behold, a door opened and out came a eunuch, bearing a chair
of ivory, inlaid with gold glittering fiery red and followed by a
damsel of passing beauty and loveliness, symmetry and grace.
He set down the chair and the damsel seated herself on it, as she
were the sun shining sheen in a sky serene. In her hand she had
a lute of Hindu make, which she laid in her lap and bent down
over it as a mother bendeth over her little one, and sang to it, after
a prelude in four-and-twenty modes, amazing all wits. Then she
returned to the first mode and to a lively measure chanted these
couplets:—</p>

<div class="lg-container-b c003">
  <div class="linegroup">
    <div class="group">
      <div class="line">Love’s tongue within my heart speaks plain to thee, ✿ Telling thee clearly I am fain of thee;</div>
      <div class="line">Witness the fevers of a tortured heart, ✿ And ulcered eyelid tear-flood rains for thee;</div>
      <div class="line">God’s fate o’ertaketh all created things! ✿ I knew not love till learnt Love’s pain of thee.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class="c000">Now when the mock Caliph heard these lines sung by the damsel,
he cried with a great cry and rent his raiment to the very skirt,
whereupon they let down a curtain over him and brought him a
fresh robe, handsomer than the first. He put it on and sat as
before, till the cup came round to him, when he struck the gong a
second time and lo! a door opened and out of it came a eunuch
with a chair of gold, followed by a damsel fairer than the first,
bearing a lute, such as would strike the envious mute. She sat
down on the chair and sang to her instrument these two couplets:—</p>

<div class="lg-container-b c003">
  <div class="linegroup">
    <div class="group">
      <div class="line"><span class="pageno" id="Page_136">136</span>How patient bide, with love in sprite of me, ✿ And tears in tempest<a id="r190"></a><a href="#f190" class="c014"><sup>[190]</sup></a> blinding sight of me?</div>
      <div class="line">By Allah, life has no delight of me! ✿ How gladden heart whose core is blight of me?</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class="c000">No sooner had the youth heard this poetry than he cried out with
a loud cry and rent his raiment to the skirt: whereupon they let
down the curtain over him and brought him another suit of clothes.
He put it on and, sitting up as before, fell again to cheerful talk,
till the cup came round to him, when he smote once more upon the
gong and out came a eunuch with a chair, followed by a damsel
fairer than she who forewent her. So she sat down on the chair,
with a lute in her hand, and sang thereto these couplets:—</p>

<div class="lg-container-b c003">
  <div class="linegroup">
    <div class="group">
      <div class="line">Cease ye this farness; ‘bate this pride of you, ✿ To whom my heart clings, by life-tide of you!</div>
      <div class="line">Have ruth on hapless, mourning, lover-wretch, ✿ Desire-full, pining, passion-tried of you:</div>
      <div class="line">Sickness hath wasted him, whose ecstasy ✿ Prays Heaven it may be satisfied of you;</div>
      <div class="line">Oh fullest moons<a id="r191"></a><a href="#f191" class="c014"><sup>[191]</sup></a> that dwell in deepest heart! ✿ How can I think of aught by side of you?</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class="c000">Now when the young man heard these couplets, he cried out with
a great cry and rent his raiment, whereupon they let fall the
curtain over him and brought him other robes. Then he returned
to his former case with his boon-companions and the bowl went
round as before, till the cup came to him, when he struck the
gong a fourth time and the door opening, out came a page-boy
bearing a chair followed by a damsel. He set the chair for her
<span class="pageno" id="Page_137">137</span>and she sat down thereon and taking the lute, tuned it and sang to
it these couplets:—</p>

<div class="lg-container-b c003">
  <div class="linegroup">
    <div class="group">
      <div class="line">When shall disunion and estrangement end? ✿ When shall my bygone joys again be kenned?</div>
      <div class="line">Yesterday we were joined in same abode; ✿ Conversing heedless of each envious friend:<a id="r192"></a><a href="#f192" class="c014"><sup>[192]</sup></a></div>
      <div class="line">Trickt us that traitor Time, disjoined our lot ✿ And our waste home to desert fate condemned:</div>
      <div class="line">Wouldst have me, Grumbler! from my dearling fly? ✿ I find my vitals blame will not perpend:</div>
      <div class="line">Cease thou to censure; leave me to repine; ✿ My mind e’er findeth thoughts that pleasure lend.</div>
      <div class="line">O Lords<a id="r193"></a><a href="#f193" class="c014"><sup>[193]</sup></a> of me who brake our troth and plight, ✿ Deem not to lose your hold of heart and sprite!</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class="c000">When the false Caliph heard the girl’s song, he cried out with a
loud outcry and rent his raiment——And Shahrazad perceived
the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say.</p>

<div>

<div class="nf-center-c1">
<div class="nf-center c005">
    <div>Now when it was the Two Hundred and Ninetieth Night,</div>
  </div>
</div>

</div>

<p class="c000">She said, When the false Caliph heard the girl’s song, he cried
with a loud outcry and rent his raiment and fell to the ground
fainting; whereupon they would have let down the curtain over
him, as of custom; but its cords stuck fast and Harun al-Rashid,
after considering him carefully, saw on his body the marks of
beating with palm-rods and said to Ja’afar, “By Allah, he is a
handsome youth, but a foul thief!” “Whence knowest thou
that, O Commander of the Faithful?” asked Ja’afar, and the
Caliph answered, “Sawest thou not the whip-scars on his ribs?”
Then they let fall the curtain over him and brought him a fresh
dress, which he put on and sat up as before with his courtiers
<span class="pageno" id="Page_138">138</span>and cup-companions. Presently he saw the Caliph and Ja’afar
whispering together and said to them, “What is the matter, fair
sirs?” Quoth Ja’afar, “O my lord, all is well,<a id="r194"></a><a href="#f194" class="c014"><sup>[194]</sup></a> save that this
my comrade, who (as is not unknown to thee) is of the merchant-company
and hath visited all the great cities and countries of the
world and hath consorted with kings and men of highest consideration,
saith to me:—Verily, that which our lord the Caliph
hath done this night is beyond measure extravagant, never saw I
any do the like doings in any country; for he hath rent such and
such dresses, each worth a thousand dinars and this is surely
excessive unthriftiness.” Replied the second Caliph, “Ho thou,
the money is my money and the stuff my stuff, and this is by way
of largesse to my suite and servants; for each suit that is rent
belongeth to one of my cup-companions here present, and I
assign to them with each suit of clothes the sum of five hundred
dinars.” The Wazir Ja’afar replied, “Well is whatso thou doest,
O our lord,” and recited these two couplets:—</p>

<div class="lg-container-b c003">
  <div class="linegroup">
    <div class="group">
      <div class="line">Virtue in hand of thee hath built a house, ✿ And to mankind thou dost thy wealth expose:</div>
      <div class="line">If an the virtues ever close their doors, ✿ That hand would be a key the lock to unclose.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class="c000">Now when the young man heard these verses recited by the
Minister Ja’afar, he ordered him to be gifted with a thousand
dinars and a dress of honour. Then the cup went round among
them and the wine was sweet to them; but, after a while quoth
the Caliph to Ja’afar, “Ask him of the marks on his sides, that
we may see what he will say by way of reply.” Answered Ja’afar,
“Softly, O my lord, be not hasty and soothe thy mind, for patience
is more becoming.” Rejoined the Caliph, “By the life of my
head and by the revered tomb of Al-Abbas,<a id="r195"></a><a href="#f195" class="c014"><sup>[195]</sup></a> except thou ask
him, I will assuredly stop thy breath!” With this the young
man turned towards the Minister and said to him, “What aileth
thee and thy friend to be whispering together? Tell me what
is the matter with you.” “It is nothing save good,” replied
Ja’afar; but the mock Caliph rejoined, “I conjure thee, by Allah,
<span class="pageno" id="Page_139">139</span>tell me what aileth you and hide from me nothing of your case.”
Answered the Wazir, “O my lord, verily this one here saw on
thy sides the marks of beating with whips and palm-fronds and
marvelled thereat with exceeding marvel, saying:—How came the
Caliph to be beaten?; and he would fain know the cause of
this.” Now when the youth heard this, he smiled and said,
“Know ye that my story is wondrous and my case marvellous;
were it graven with needles on the eye-corners, it would serve
as a warner to whoso would be warned.” And he sighed and
repeated these couplets:—</p>

<div class="lg-container-b c003">
  <div class="linegroup">
    <div class="group">
      <div class="line">Strange is my story, passing prodigy; ✿ By Love I swear, my ways wax strait on me!</div>
      <div class="line">An ye desire to hear me, listen, and ✿ Let all in this assembly silent be.</div>
      <div class="line">Heed ye my words which are of meaning deep, ✿ Nor lies my speech; ‘tis truest verity.</div>
      <div class="line">I’m slain<a id="r196"></a><a href="#f196" class="c014"><sup>[196]</sup></a> by longing and by ardent love; ✿ My slayer’s the pearl of fair virginity.</div>
      <div class="line">She hath a jet black eye like Hindi blade, ✿ And bowèd eyebrows shoot her archery;</div>
      <div class="line">My heart assures me our Imam is here, ✿ This age’s Caliph, old nobility:</div>
      <div class="line">Your second, Ja’afar hight, is his Wazir; ✿ A Sáhib,<a id="r197"></a><a href="#f197" class="c014"><sup>[197]</sup></a> Sahib-son of high degree:</div>
      <div class="line">The third is called Masrur who wields the sword: ✿ Now, if in words of mine some truth you see,</div>
      <div class="line">I have won every wish by this event ✿ Which fills my heart with joy and gladdest gree.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class="c000">When they heard these words Ja’afar swore to him an ambiguous
oath that they were not those he named, whereupon he laughed
and said:—Know, O my lords, that I am not the Commander of
the Faithful and that I do but style myself thus, to win my will of
the sons of the city. My true name is Mohammed Ali, son of Ali
the Jeweller, and my father was one of the notables of Baghdad,
who left me great store of gold and silver and pearls and coral
and rubies and chrysolites and other jewels, besides messuages and
lands, Hammam-baths and brickeries, orchards and flower-gardens.
Now as I sat in my shop one day surrounded by my eunuchs and
dependents, behold, there came up a young lady, mounted on a
<span class="pageno" id="Page_140">140</span>she-mule and attended by three damsels like moons. Riding up
to my shop she alighted and seated herself by my side and said,
“Art thou Mohammed the Jeweller?” Replied I, “Even so! I
am he, thy Mameluke, thy chattel.” She asked, “Hast thou a
necklace of jewels fit for me?” and I answered, “O my lady, I will
show thee what I have; and lay all before thee and, if any please
thee, it will be of thy slave’s good luck; if they please thee not, of
his ill fortune.” Now I had by me an hundred necklaces and
showed them all to her; but none of them pleased her and she
said, “I want a better than those I have seen.” I had a small
necklace which my father had bought at an hundred thousand
dinars and whose like was not to be found with any of the great
kings; so I said to her, “O my lady, I have yet one necklace of
fine stones fit for bezels, the like of which none possesseth, great
or small.” Said she, “Show it to me,” so I showed it to her, and
she said, “This is what I wanted and what I have wished for all
my life;” adding, “What is its price?” Quoth I, “It cost my
father an hundred thousand dinars;” and she said, “I will give
thee five thousand dinars to thy profit.” I answered, “O my lady,
the necklace and its owner are at thy service and I cannot gainsay
thee.” But she rejoined, “Needs must thou have the profit, and
I am still most grateful to thee.” Then she rose without stay or
delay; and, mounting the mule in haste, said to me, “O my lord,
in Allah’s name, favour us with thy company to receive the
money; for this thy day with us is white as milk.”<a id="r198"></a><a href="#f198" class="c014"><sup>[198]</sup></a> So I shut the
shop and accompanied her, in all security, till we came to a house,
on which were manifest the signs of wealth and rank; for its door
was wrought with gold and silver and ultramarine, and thereon
were written these two couplets:—</p>

<div class="lg-container-b c003">
  <div class="linegroup">
    <div class="group">
      <div class="line">Hola, thou mansion! woe ne’er enter thee; ✿ Nor be thine owner e’er misused of Fate;</div>
      <div class="line">Excellent mansion to all guests art thou, ✿ When other mansions to the guest are strait.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class="c000">The young lady dismounted and entered the house, bidding me sit
down on the bench at the gate, till the money-changer should
arrive. So I sat awhile, when behold, a damsel came out to me
and said, “O my lord, enter the vestibule; for it is a dishonour
<span class="pageno" id="Page_141">141</span>that thou shouldst sit at the gate.” Thereupon I arose and
entered the vestibule and sat down on the settle there; and, as I
sat, lo! another damsel came out and said to me, “O my lord,
my mistress biddeth thee enter and sit down at the door of
the saloon, to receive thy money.” I entered and sat down, nor
had I sat a moment when behold, a curtain of silk which concealed
a throne of gold was drawn aside, and I saw seated thereon the
lady who had made the purchase; and round her neck she wore
the necklace which looked pale and wan by the side of a face as it
were the rounded moon. At her sight, my wit was troubled and
my mind confounded, by reason of her exceeding beauty and loveliness;
but when she saw me she rose from her throne and coming
close up to me, said, “O light of mine eyes, is every handsome one
like thee pitiless to his mistress?” I answered, “O my lady, beauty,
all of it, is in thee and is but one of thy hidden charms.” And
she rejoined, “O Jeweller, know that I love thee and can hardly
credit that I have brought thee hither.” Then she bent towards
me and I kissed her and she kissed me and, as she caressed me,
drew me towards her and to her breast she pressed me.——And
Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her
permitted say.</p>

<div>

<div class="nf-center-c1">
<div class="nf-center c005">
    <div>Now when it was the Two Hundred and Ninety-first Night,</div>
  </div>
</div>

</div>

<p class="c000">She said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that the Jeweller
continued:—Then she bent towards me and kissed and caressed
me; and, as she caressed me, drew me towards her and to her
breast she pressed me. Now she knew by my condition that I
had a mind to enjoy her; so she said to me, “O my lord, wouldst
thou foregather with me unlawfully? By Allah, may he not live
who would do the like of this sin and who takes pleasure in talk
unclean! I am a maid, a virgin whom no man hath approached,
nor am I unknown in the city. Knowest thou who I am?”
Quoth I, “No, by Allah, O my lady!”; and quoth she, “I am
the Lady Dunyá, daughter of Yáhyá bin Khálid the Barmecide
and sister of Ja’afar, Wazir to the Caliph.” Now as I heard this,
I drew back from her, saying, “O my lady, it is no fault of mine
if I have been over-bold with thee; it was thou didst encourage
me to aspire to thy love, by giving me access to thee.” She
answered, “No harm shall befal thee, and needs must thou attain
<span class="pageno" id="Page_142">142</span>thy desire in the only way pleasing to Allah. I am my own
mistress and the Kazi shall act as my guardian in consenting to
the marriage contract; for it is my will that I be to thee wife and
thou be to me man.” Then she sent for the Kazi and the witnesses
and busied herself with making ready; and, when they came, she
said to them, “Mohammed Ali, bin Ali the Jeweller, seeketh me
in wedlock and hath given me the necklace to my marriage-settlement;
and I accept and consent.” So they wrote out the contract
of marriage between us; and ere I went in to her the servants
brought the wine-furniture and the cups passed round after the
fairest fashion and the goodliest ordering; and, when the wine
mounted to our heads, she ordered a damsel, a lute-player,<a id="r199"></a><a href="#f199" class="c014"><sup>[199]</sup></a> to
sing. So she took the lute and sang to a pleasing and stirring
motive these couplets:—</p>

<div class="lg-container-b c003">
  <div class="linegroup">
    <div class="group">
      <div class="line">He comes; and fawn and branch and moon delight these eyne ✿ Fie<a id="r200"></a><a href="#f200" class="c014"><sup>[200]</sup></a> on his heart who sleeps o’ nights without repine;</div>
      <div class="line">Fair youth, for whom Heaven willed to quench in cheek one light, ✿ And left another light on other cheek bright li’en:</div>
      <div class="line">I fain finesse my chiders when they mention him, ✿ As though the hearing of his name I would decline;</div>
      <div class="line">And willing ear I lend when they of other speak; ✿ Yet would my soul within outflow in floods of brine:</div>
      <div class="line">Beauty’s own prophet, he is all a miracle ✿ Of heavenly grace, and greatest shows his face for sign:<a id="r201"></a><a href="#f201" class="c014"><sup>[201]</sup></a></div>
      <div class="line">To prayer Bilál-like cries that Mole upon his cheek ✿ To ward from pearly brow all eyes of ill design:<a id="r202"></a><a href="#f202" class="c014"><sup>[202]</sup></a></div>
      <div class="line">The censors of their ignorance would my love dispel ✿ But after Faith I can’t at once turn Infidel.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class="c000">We were ravished by the sweet music she made striking the
strings, and the beauty of the verses she sang; and the other
damsels went on to sing and to recite one after another, till ten
<span class="pageno" id="Page_143">143</span>had so done; when the Lady Dunya took the lute and playing
a lively measure, chanted these couplets:—</p>

<div class="lg-container-b c003">
  <div class="linegroup">
    <div class="group">
      <div class="line">I swear by swayings of that form so fair, ✿ Aye from thy parting fiery pangs I bear:</div>
      <div class="line">Pity a heart which burneth in thy love, ✿ O bright as fullest moon in blackest air!</div>
      <div class="line">Vouchsafe thy boons to him who ne’er will cease ✿ In light of wine-cup all thy charms declare,</div>
      <div class="line">Amid the roses which with varied hues ✿ Are to the myrtle-bush<a id="r203"></a><a href="#f203" class="c014"><sup>[203]</sup></a> a mere despair.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class="c000">When she had finished her verse; I took the lute from her hands
and, playing a quaint and no vulgar prelude sang the following
verses:—</p>

<div class="lg-container-b c003">
  <div class="linegroup">
    <div class="group">
      <div class="line">Laud to my Lord who gave thee all of loveliness; ✿ Myself amid thy thralls I willingly confess:</div>
      <div class="line">O thou, whose eyes and glances captivate mankind, ✿ Pray that I ‘scape those arrows shot with all thy stress!</div>
      <div class="line">Two hostile rivals water and enflaming fire ✿ Thy cheek hath married, which for marvel I profess:</div>
      <div class="line">Thou art Sa’ír in heart of me and eke Na’ím;<a id="r204"></a><a href="#f204" class="c014"><sup>[204]</sup></a> ✿ Thou <i><span xml:lang="it" lang="it">agro-dolce</span></i>, eke heart’s sweetest bitterness.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class="c000">When she heard this my song she rejoiced with exceeding joy;
then, dismissing her slave-women, she brought me to a most
goodly place, where they had spread us a bed of various colours.
She did off her clothes and I had a lover’s privacy of her and
found her a pearl unpierced and a filly unridden. So I rejoiced
in her and never in my born days spent I a more delicious night.——And
Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying
her permitted say.</p>

<div>

<div class="nf-center-c1">
<div class="nf-center c005">
    <div>Now when it was the Two Hundred and Ninety-second Night,</div>
  </div>
</div>

</div>

<p class="c000">She said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that Mohammed
bin Ali the Jeweller continued:—So I went in unto the Lady
Dunya, daughter of Yahya bin Khalid the Barmecide, and I found
<span class="pageno" id="Page_144">144</span>her a pearl unthridden and a filly unridden. So I rejoiced in her
and repeated these couplets:—</p>

<div class="lg-container-b c003">
  <div class="linegroup">
    <div class="group">
      <div class="line">O Night here stay! I want no morning light; ✿ My lover’s face to me is lamp and light:<a id="r205"></a><a href="#f205" class="c014"><sup>[205]</sup></a></div>
      <div class="line">As ring of ring-dove round his neck’s my arm; ✿ And made my palm his mouth-veil; and, twas right.</div>
      <div class="line">This be the crown of bliss, and ne’er we’ll cease ✿ To clip, nor care to be in other plight.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class="c000">And I abode with her a whole month, forsaking shop and family
and home, till one day she said to me, “O light of my eyes, O
my lord Mohammed, I have determined to go to the Hammam
to-day; so sit thou on this couch and rise not from thy place, till
I return to thee.” “I hear and I obey,” answered I, and she made
me swear to this; after which she took her women and went off
to the bath. But by Allah, O my brothers, she had not reached
the head of the street ere the door opened and in came an old
woman, who said to me, “O my lord Mohammed, the Lady
Zubaydah biddeth thee to her, for she hath heard of thy fine
manners and accomplishments and skill in singing.” I answered,
“By Allah, I will not rise from my place, till the Lady Dunya
come back.” Rejoined the old woman, “O my lord, do not anger
the Lady Zubaydah with thee and vex her so as to make her thy
foe: nay, rise up and speak with her and return to thy place.”
So I rose at once and followed her into the presence of the Lady
Zubaydah and, when I entered her presence she said to me, “O
light of the eye, art thou the Lady Dunya’s beloved?” “I am
thy Mameluke, thy chattel,” replied I. Quoth she, “Sooth spake
he who reported thee possessed of beauty and grace and good
breeding and every fine quality; indeed, thou surpassest all praise
and all report. But now sing to me, that I may hear thee.”
Quoth I, “Hearkening and obedience;” so she brought me a lute,
and I sang to it these couplets:—</p>

<div class="lg-container-b c003">
  <div class="linegroup">
    <div class="group">
      <div class="line">The hapless lover’s heart is of his wooing weary grown; ✿ And hand of sickness wasted him till naught but skin and bone:</div>
      <div class="line">Who should be amid the riders which the haltered camels urge, ✿ But that same lover whose beloved doth in the litters wone:</div>
      <div class="line"><span class="pageno" id="Page_145">145</span>To Allah’s charge I leave that moon-like Beauty in your tents ✿ Whom my heart loves, albe my glance on her may ne’er be thrown.</div>
      <div class="line">Now she is fain; then she is fierce: how sweet her coyness shows; ✿ Yea, sweet whatever doth or saith to lover lovèd one!</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class="c000">When I had finished my song she said to me, “Allah assain thy
body and thy voice! Verily, thou art perfect in beauty and good
breeding and singing. But now rise and return to thy place, ere
the Lady Dunya come back, lest she find thee not and be wroth
with thee.” Then I kissed the ground before her and the old
woman forewent me till I reached the door whence I came. So
I entered and, going up to the couch, found that my wife had
come back from the bath and was lying asleep there. Seeing
this I sat down at her feet and rubbed them; whereupon she
opened her eyes and seeing me, drew up both her feet and gave
me a kick that threw me off the couch,<a id="r206"></a><a href="#f206" class="c014"><sup>[206]</sup></a> saying, “O traitor, thou
hast been false to thine oath and hast perjured thyself. Thou
swarest to me that thou wouldst not rise from thy place; yet
didst thou break thy promise and go to the Lady Zubaydah. By
Allah, but that I fear public scandal, I would pull down her palace
over her head!” Then said she to her black slave, “O Sawáb,
arise and strike off this lying traitor’s head, for we have no further
need of him.” So the slave came up to me and, tearing a strip
from his skirt, bandaged with it my eyes<a id="r207"></a><a href="#f207" class="c014"><sup>[207]</sup></a> and would have struck
off my head;——And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and
ceased to say her permitted say.</p>

<div>

<div class="nf-center-c1">
<div class="nf-center c005">
    <div>Now when it was the Two Hundred and Ninety-third Night,</div>
  </div>
</div>

</div>

<p class="c000">She said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that Mohammed
the Jeweller continued:—So the slave came up to me and, tearing
a strip from his skirt, bandaged with it my eyes and would have
struck off my head; but all her women, great and small, rose and
came up to her and said to her, “O our lady, this is not the first
<span class="pageno" id="Page_146">146</span>who hath erred: indeed, he knew not thy humour and hath done
thee no offence deserving death.” Replied she, “By Allah, I must
needs set my mark on him.” And she bade them bash me; so
they beat me on my ribs and the marks ye saw are the scars of
that fustigation. Then she ordered them to cast me out, and they
carried me to a distance from the house and threw me down like
a log. After a time I rose and dragged myself little by little to
my own place, where I sent for a surgeon and showed him my
hurts; and he comforted me and did his best to cure me. As
soon as I was recovered I went to the Hammam and, as my pains
and sickness had left me, I repaired to my shop and took and sold
all that was therein. With the proceeds, I bought me four hundred
white slaves, such as no King ever got together, and caused two
hundred of them to ride out with me every day. Then I made
me yonder barge whereon I spent five thousand gold pieces; and
styled myself Caliph and appointed each of my servants to the
charge of some one of the Caliph’s officers and clad him in official
habit. Moreover, I made proclamation, “Whoso goeth a-pleasuring
on the Tigris by night, I will strike off his head, without ruth or
delay;” and on such wise have I done this whole year past, during
which time I have heard no news of the lady neither happened
upon any trace of her. Then wept he copiously and repeated
these couplets:—</p>

<div class="lg-container-b c003">
  <div class="linegroup">
    <div class="group">
      <div class="line">By Allah! while the days endure ne’er shall forget her I, ✿ Nor draw to any nigh save those who draw her to me nigh:</div>

      <div class="line">She left me full of mourning, sleepless, sick with pine and pain ✿ And ceaseth not my heart to yearn her mystery<a id="r208"></a><a href="#f208" class="c014"><sup>[208]</sup></a> to espy.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class="c000">Now when Harun al-Rashid heard the young man’s story and
knew the passion and transport and love-lowe that afflicted him,
he was moved to compassion and wonder and said, “Glory be to
Allah, who hath appointed to every effect a cause!” Then they
craved the young man’s permission to depart; which being granted,
they took leave of him, the Caliph purposing to do him justice
meet, and him with the utmost munificence entreat; and they returned
to the palace of the Caliphate, where they changed clothes
<span class="pageno" id="Page_147">147</span>for others befitting their state and sat down, whilst Masrur the
Sworder of High Justice stood before them. After awhile, quoth
the Caliph to Ja’afar, “O Wazir, bring me the young man”——And
Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her
permitted say.</p>

<p class="c000">She said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that quoth the
Caliph to his Minister, “Bring me the young man with whom we
were last night.” “I hear and obey,” answered Ja’afar and, going
to the youth, saluted him, saying, “Obey the summons of the
Commander of the Faithful, the Caliph Harun al-Rashid.” So
he returned with him to the palace, in great anxiety by reason of
the summons; and, going in to the King, kissed ground before
him; and offered up a prayer for the endurance of his glory and
prosperity, for the accomplishment of his desires, for the continuance
of his beneficence and for the cessation of evil and
punishment; ordering his speech as best he might and ending
by saying, “Peace be on thee, O Prince of True Believers and
Protector of the folk of the Faith!” Then he repeated these
two couplets:—</p>

<div class="lg-container-b c003">
  <div class="linegroup">
    <div class="group">
      <div class="line">Kiss thou his fingers which no fingers are; ✿ Keys of our daily bread those fingers ken:</div>
      <div class="line">And praise his actions which no actions are; ✿ But precious necklaces round necks of men.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class="c000">So the Caliph smiled in his face and returned his salute, looking
on him with the eye of favour; then he bade him draw near and
sit down before him and said to him, “O Mohammed Ali, I wish
thee to tell me what befel thee last night, for it was strange and
passing strange.” Quoth the youth, “Pardon, O Commander of
the Faithful, give me the kerchief of immunity, that my dread
may be appeased and my heart eased.” Replied the Caliph, “I
promise thee safety from fear and woes.” So the young man told
him his story from first to last, whereby the Caliph knew him to
be a lover and severed from his beloved and said to him, “Desirest
thou that I restore her to thee?” “This were of the bounty of
the Commander of the Faithful,” answered the youth and repeated
these two couplets:—</p>

    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class="c000">Thereupon the Caliph turned to his Minister and said to him, “O
Ja’afar, bring me thy sister, the Lady Dunya, daughter of the
Wazir Yahya bin Khalid!” “I hear and I obey,” answered he
and fetched her without let or delay. Now when she stood before
the Caliph he said to her, “Dost thou know who this is?”; and she
replied, “O Commander of the Faithful, how should women have
knowledge of men?”<a id="r210"></a><a href="#f210" class="c014"><sup>[210]</sup></a> So the Caliph smiled and said, “O Dunya,
this is thy beloved, Mohammed bin Ali the Jeweller. We are
acquainted with his case, for we have heard the whole story from
beginning to end, and have apprehended its inward and its outward;
and it is no more hidden from me, for all it was kept in
secrecy.” Replied she, “O Commander of the Faithful, this was
written in the Book of Destiny; I crave the forgiveness of
Almighty Allah for the wrong I have wrought, and pray thee to
pardon me of thy favour.” At this the Caliph laughed and, summoning
the Kazi and witnesses, renewed the marriage-contract
between the Lady Dunya and her husband, Mohammed Ali son of
the Jeweller whereby there betided them, both her and him the
utmost felicity, and to their enviers mortification and misery.
Moreover, he made Mohammed Ali one of his boon-companions,
and they abode in joy and cheer and gladness, till there came to
them the Destroyer of delights and the Sunderer of societies.

“Set.” The Arab word extended to China and was given to the hurricanes which
the people call “Tae-foong,” great winds, a second whimsical resemblance. But Sir
John Davis (ii. 383) is hardly correct when he says, “the name typhoon, in itself a

<p class="c013">It is said that the Caliph Harun al-Rashid, being restless one
night, sent for his Wazir and said to him, “O Ja’afar, I am sore
wakeful and heavy-hearted this night, and I desire of thee what
may solace my spirit and cause my breast to broaden with amusement.”
Quoth Ja’afar, “O Commander of the Faithful, I have a
friend, by name Ali the Persian, who hath store of tales and pleasant
stories, such as lighten the heart and make care depart.”
Quoth the Caliph, “Fetch him to me,” and quoth Ja’afar, “Hearkening
and obedience;” and, going out from before him, sent to
seek Ali the Persian and when he came said to him, “Answer the
summons of the Commander of the Faithful.” “To hear is to
obey,” answered Ali;——And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of
day and ceased to say her permitted say.</p>

</div>

<p class="c000">She said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that the Persian
replied, “To hear is to obey;” and at once followed the Wazir
into the presence of the Caliph who bade him be seated and said
to him, “O Ali, my heart is heavy within me this night and it hath
come to my ear that thou hast great store of tales and anecdotes;
so I desire of thee that thou let me hear what will relieve my
despondency and brighten my melancholy.” Said he, “O Commander
of the Faithful, shall I tell thee what I have seen with
my eyes or what I have heard with my ears?” He replied, “An
thou have seen aught worth the telling, let me hear that.” Replied
Ali:—Hearkening and obedience. Know thou, O Commander
of the Faithful, that some years ago I left this my native
city of Baghdad on a journey, having with me a lad who carried
a light leathern bag. Presently we came to a certain city, where,
as I was buying and selling behold, a rascally Kurd fell on me
and seized my wallet perforce, saying, “This is my bag, and all
which is in it is my property.” Thereupon, I cried aloud “Ho
Moslems,<a id="r211"></a><a href="#f211" class="c014"><sup>[211]</sup></a> one and all, deliver me from the hand of the vilest of
<span class="pageno" id="Page_150">150</span>oppressors!” But the folk said, “Come, both of you, to the
Kazi and abide ye by his judgement with joint consent.” So I
agreed to submit myself to such decision and we both presented
ourselves before the Kazi, who said, “What bringeth you hither
and what is your case and your quarrel?” Quoth I, “We are men
at difference, who appeal to thee and make complaint and submit
ourselves to thy judgement.” Asked the Kazi, “Which of you is
the complainant?”; so the Kurd came forward<a id="r212"></a><a href="#f212" class="c014"><sup>[212]</sup></a> and said, “Allah
preserve our lord the Kazi! Verily, this bag is my bag and all
that is in it is my swag. It was lost from me and I found it with
this man mine enemy.” The Kazi asked, “When didst thou lose
it?”; and the Kurd answered, “But yesterday, and I passed a
sleepless night by reason of its loss.” “And<a id="p150"></a> it be thy bag,” quoth
the Kazi, “tell me what is in it.” Quoth the Kurd, “There were
in my bag two silver styles for eye-powder and antimony for the
eyes and a kerchief for the hands, wherein I had laid two gilt cups
and two candlesticks. Moreover it contained two tents and two
platters and two spoons and a cushion and two leather rugs and
two ewers and a brass tray and two basins and a cooking-pot and
two water-jars and a ladle and a sacking-needle and a she-cat and
two bitches and a wooden trencher and two sacks and two saddles
and a gown and two fur pelisses and a cow and two calves and a
she-goat and two sheep and an ewe and two lambs and two green
pavilions and a camel and two she-camels and a lioness and two
lions and a she-bear and two jackals and a mattrass and two sofas
and an upper chamber and two saloons and a portico and two
sitting-rooms and a kitchen with two doors and a company of
Kurds who will bear witness that the bag is my bag.” Then said
the Kazi to me, “And thou, sirrah, what sayest thou?” So I came
forward, O commander of the Faithful (and indeed the Kurd’s
speech had bewildered me) and said, “Allah advance our lord the
Kazi! Verily, there was naught in this my wallet, save a little
ruined tenement and another without a door and a dog-house and a
boys’ school and youths playing dice and tents and tent-ropes and
the cities of Bassorah and Baghdad and the palace of Shaddad bin
Ad and an ironsmith’s forge and a fishing-net and cudgels and pickets
and girls and boys and a thousand pimps who will testify that the
bag is my bag.” Now when the Kurd heard my words, he wept and
<span class="pageno" id="Page_151">151</span>wailed and said, “O my lord the Kazi, this my bag is known and
what is in it is a matter of renown; for in this bag there be castles
and citadels and cranes and beasts of prey and men playing
chess and draughts. Furthermore, in this my bag is a brood-mare
and two colts and a stallion and two blood-steeds and two long
lances; and it containeth eke a lion and two hares and a city and
two villages and a whore and two sharking panders and an hermaphrodite
and two gallows-birds and a blind man and two wights
with good sight and a limping cripple and two lameters and a
Christian ecclesiastic and two deacons and a patriarch and two
monks and a Kazi and two assessors, who will be evidence that
the bag is my bag.” Quoth the Kazi to me, “And what sayst
thou, O Ali?” So, O Commander of the Faithful, being filled
with rage, I came forward and said, “Allah keep our lord the
Kazi!”——And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased
saying her permitted say.</p>

and from India to the Sudán. Therein also (may Allah prolong
the life of our lord the Kazi!) are doublets and cloths and
a thousand sharp razors to shave off the Kazi’s beard, except he
fear my resentment and adjudge the bag to be my bag.” Now
when the Kazi heard what I and the Kurd avouched, he was
confounded and said, “I see ye twain be none other than two
pestilent fellows, atheistical villains who make sport of Kazis and
magistrates and stand not in fear of reproach. Never did tongue
tell nor ear hear aught more extraordinary than that which ye
pretend. By Allah, from China to Shajarat Umm Ghaylán, nor
from Fars to Sudan nor from Wadi Nu’uman to Khorasan, was
ever heard the like of what ye avouch or credited the like of what
ye affirm. Say, fellows, be this bag a bottomless sea or the Day
of Resurrection that shall gather together the just and unjust?”
Then the Kazi bade them open the bag; so I opened it and
behold, there was in it bread and a lemon and cheese and olives.
So I threw the bag down before the Kurd and ganged my gait.
Now when the Caliph heard this tale from Ali the Persian, he

<p class="c013">It is said that Ja’afar the Barmecide was one night carousing
with Al-Rashid, who said, “O Ja’afar, it hath reached me that
thou hast bought such and such a slave-girl. Now I have
long sought her for she is passing fair; and my heart is taken up
with love of her, so do thou sell her to me.” He replied, “I will
not sell her, O Commander of the Faithful.” Quoth he, “Then
give her to me.” Quoth the other, “Nor will I give her.” Then
Al-Rashid exclaimed, “Be Zubaydah triply divorced an thou
shall not either sell or give her to me!” Then Ja’afar, exclaimed,
“Be my wife triply divorced an I either sell or give her to
thee!” After awhile they recovered from their tipsiness and
were aware of having fallen into a grave dilemma, but knew not
by what device to extricate themselves. Then said Al-Rashid,
“None can help us in this strait but Abú Yúsuf.”<a id="r216"></a><a href="#f216" class="c014"><sup>[216]</sup></a> So they sent
for him, and this was in the middle of the night; and when the
messenger reached him, he arose in alarm, saying to himself, “I
should not be sent for at this tide and time, save by reason of
some question of moment to Al-Islam.” So he went out in haste
and mounted his she-mule, saying to his servant, “Take the mule’s
nose-bag with thee; it may be she hath not finished her feed; and
when we come to the Caliph’s palace, put the bag on her, that she
may eat what is left of her fodder, during the last of the night.”
And the man replied, “I hear and obey.” Now when the Imam
was admitted to the presence, Al-Rashid rose to receive him and
seated him on the couch beside himself (where he was wont to
seat none save the Kazi), and said to him, “We have not sent for
thee at this untimely time and tide save to advise us upon a grave
<span class="pageno" id="Page_154">154</span>matter, which is such and such and wherewith we know not how
to deal.” And he expounded to him the case. Abu Yusuf
answered, “O Commander of the Faithful, this is the easiest of
things.” Then he turned to Ja’afar and said, “O Ja’afar, sell half
of her to the Commander of the Faithful and give him the other
half; so shall ye both be quit of your oaths.” The Caliph was
delighted with this and both did as he prescribed. Then said
Al-Rashid, “Bring me the girl at once,”— —And Shahrazad perceived
the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say.</p>

<div class="nf-center c005">
    <div>Now when it was the Two Hundred and Ninety-seventh Night,</div>

</div>

</div>

<p class="c000">She said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that the Caliph
Harun al-Rashid commanded, “Bring me the girl at once, for
I long for her exceedingly.” So they brought her and the Caliph
said to Abu Yusuf, “I have a mind to have her forthright; for
I cannot bear to abstain from her during the prescribed period
of purification; now how is this to be done?” Abu Yusuf
replied, “Bring me one of thine own male slaves who hath never
been manumitted.” So they brought one and Abu Yusuf said,
“Give me leave to marry her to him; then let him divorce her
before consummation; and thus shall it be lawful for thee to lie
with her before purification.” This second expedient pleased the
Caliph yet more than the first; he sent for the Mameluke and,
whenas he came, said to the Kazi, “I authorise thee to marry her
to him.” So the Imam proposed the marriage to the slave, who
accepted it and performed the ceremony; after which he said to
the slave, “Divorce her, and thou shalt have an hundred dinars.”
But he replied, “I won’t do this;” and the Imam went on to
increase his offer, and the slave to refuse till he bid him a thousand
dinars. Then the man asked him, “Doth it rest with me to
divorce her, or with thee or with the Commander of the Faithful?”
He answered, “It is in thy hand.” “Then by Allah,”
quoth the slave, “I will never do it; no, never!” Hearing these
words the Caliph was exceeding wroth and said to the Imam,
“What is to be done, O Abu Yusuf?” Replied he, “Be not
concerned, O Commander of the Faithful; the thing is easy.
Make this slave the damsel’s chattel.” Quoth Al-Rashid, “I give
him to her;” and the Imam said to the girl, “Say:—I accept.”
So she said, “I accept;” whereon quoth Abu Yusuf, “I pronounce
separation from bed and board and divorce between them,
<span class="pageno" id="Page_155">155</span>for that he hath become her property, and so the marriage is
annulled.” With this, Al-Rashid rose to his feet and exclaimed,
“It is the like of thee that shall be Kazi in my time.” Then he
called for sundry trays of gold and emptied them before Abu
Yusuf, to whom he said, “Hast thou wherein to put this?” The
Imam bethought him of the mule’s nose-bag; so he sent for it
and, filling it with gold, took it and went home. And on the
morrow, he said to his friends, “There is no easier nor shorter
road to the goods of this world and the next, than that of religious
learning; for, see, I have gotten all this money by answering two
or three questions.” So consider thou, O polite reader,<a id="r217"></a><a href="#f217" class="c014"><sup>[217]</sup></a> the
pleasantness of this anecdote, for it compriseth divers goodly
features, amongst which are the complaisance of Ja’afar to Al-Rashid,
and the wisdom of the Caliph who chose such a Kazi

  <h2 id="c155" class="c007">TALE OF THE LOVER WHO FEIGNED HIMSELF A THIEF.</h2>
</div>

<p class="c013">When Khálid ibn Abdallah al-Kasri<a id="r218"></a><a href="#f218" class="c014"><sup>[218]</sup></a> was Emir of Bassorah,
there came to him one day a company of men dragging a youth
of exceeding beauty and lofty bearing and perfumed attire; whose
aspect expressed good breeding, abundant wit and dignity of the
gravest. They brought him before the Governor, who asked what
it was and they replied, “This fellow is a thief, whom we caught
last night in our dwelling-house.” Whereupon Khalid looked at
him and was pleased with his well-favouredness and elegant
aspect; so he said to the others, “Loose him,” and going up
to the young man, asked what he had to say for himself. He
replied, “Verily the folk have spoken truly and the case is as
they have said.” Quoth Khalid, “And what moved thee to this
and thou so noble of port and comely of mien?” Quoth the
<span class="pageno" id="Page_156">156</span>other “The lust after worldly good, and the ordinance of Allah
(extolled and exalted be He!).” Rejoined Khalid, “Be thy
mother bereaved of thee!<a id="r219"></a><a href="#f219" class="c014"><sup>[219]</sup></a> Hadst thou not, in thy fair face and
sound sense and good breeding, what should restrain thee from
thieving?” Answered the young man, “O Emir, leave this talk
and proceed to what Almighty Allah hath ordained; this is what
my hands have earned, and, ‘God is not unjust towards mankind.’”<a id="r220"></a><a href="#f220" class="c014"><sup>[220]</sup></a>
So Khalid was silent awhile considering the matter;
then he bade the young man draw near him and said, “Verily,
thy confession before witnesses perplexeth me, for I cannot
believe thee to be a thief: haply thou hast some story that is
other than one of theft; and if so tell it me.” Replied the youth,
“O Emir, imagine naught other than what I have confessed to
in thy presence; for I have no tale to tell save that verily I
entered these folks’ house and stole what I could lay hands on,
and they caught me and took the stuff from me and carried me
before thee.” Then Khalid bade clap him in gaol and commanded
a crier to cry throughout Bassorah, “O yes! O yes!
Whoso be minded to look upon the punishment of such an one,
the thief, and the cutting-off of his hand, let him be present
to-morrow morning at such a place!” Now when the young
man found himself in prison, with irons on his feet, he sighed
heavily and with tears streaming from his eyes extemporised these
couplets:—</p>

<div class="lg-container-b c003">
  <div class="linegroup">
    <div class="group">
      <div class="line">When Khálid menaced off to strike my hand ✿ If I refuse to tell him of her case;</div>
      <div class="line">Quoth I, “Far, far fro’ me that I should tell ✿ A love, which ever shall my heart engrace;</div>
      <div class="line">Loss of my hand for sin I have confessed ✿ To me were easier than to shame her face.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class="c000">The warders heard him and went and told Khalid who, when it
was dark night, sent for the youth and conversed with him. He
found him clever and well-bred, intelligent, lively and a pleasant
companion; so he ordered him food and he ate. Then after an
<span class="pageno" id="Page_157">157</span>hour’s talk said Khalid, “I know indeed thou hast a story to tell
that is no thief’s; so when the Kazi shall come to-morrow morning
and shall question thee about this robbery, do thou deny
the charge of theft and avouch what may avert the pain and
penalty of cutting off thy hand; for the Apostle (whom Allah
bless and keep!) saith:—In cases of doubt, eschew punishment.”
Then he sent him back to prison——And Shahrazad perceived
the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say.</p>

<div>

<div class="nf-center-c1">
<div class="nf-center c005">
    <div>Now when it was the Two Hundred and Ninety-eighth Night,</div>
  </div>
</div>

</div>

<p class="c000">She said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that Khalid,
after conversing with the youth, sent him back to prison, where
he passed the night. And when morning dawned the folk
assembled to see his hand cut off, nor was there a soul in
Bassorah, man or woman, but was present to look upon the
punishment of that handsome youth. Then Khalid mounted in
company of the notables of the city and others; and, summoning
all four Kazis, sent for the young man, who came hobbling and
stumbling in his fetters. There was none saw him but wept over
him and the women all lifted up their voices in lamentation as
for the dead. Then the Kazi bade silence the women and said
to the prisoner, “These folk avouch that thou didst enter their
dwelling-house and steal their goods: belike thou stolest less
than a quarter dinar<a id="r221"></a><a href="#f221" class="c014"><sup>[221]</sup></a>?” Replied he, “Nay, I stole that and
more.” “Peradventure,” rejoined the Kazi, “thou art partner with
the folk in some of the goods?” Quoth the young man; “Not
so: it was all theirs, and I had no right in it.” At this the
Khalid was wroth and rose and smote him on the face with his
whip, applying to his own case this couplet:—</p>

<div class="lg-container-b c003">
  <div class="linegroup">
    <div class="group">
      <div class="line">Man wills his wish to him accorded be; ✿ But Allah naught accords save what He wills.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class="c000">Then he called for the butcher to do the work, who came and
drew forth his knife and taking the prisoner’s hand set the blade
to it, when, behold, a damsel pressed through the crowd of women
<span class="pageno" id="Page_158">158</span>clad in tattered clothes,<a id="r222"></a><a href="#f222" class="c014"><sup>[222]</sup></a> and cried out and threw herself on the
young man. Then she unveiled and showed a face like the moon;
whereupon the people raised a mighty clamour and there was like
to have been a riot amongst them and a violent scene. But she
cried out her loudest, saying, “I conjure thee, by Allah, O Emir,
hasten not to cut off this man’s hand, till thou have read what
is in this scroll!” So saying, she gave him a scroll, and Khalid
took it and opened it and read therein these couplets:—</p>

<div class="lg-container-b c003">
  <div class="linegroup">
    <div class="group">
      <div class="line">“Ah Khalid! this one is a slave of love distraught, ✿ And these bowed eyelashes sent shaft that caused his grief:</div>
      <div class="line">Shot him an arrow sped by eyes of mine, for he, ✿ Wedded to burning love, of ills hath no relief:</div>
      <div class="line">He hath avowed a deed he never did, the while ✿ Deeming this better than disgrace of lover lief:</div>
      <div class="line">Bear then, I pray, with this distracted lover mine ✿ Whose noble nature falsely calls himself a thief!”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class="c000">When Khalid had read these lines; he withdrew himself from
the people and summoned the girl and questioned her; and she
told him that the young man was her lover and she his mistress;
and that thinking to visit her he came to the dwelling of her
people and threw a stone into the house, to warn her of his
coming. Her father and brothers heard the noise of the stone
and sallied out on him; but he, hearing them coming, caught up
all the household stuff and made himself appear a robber to cover
his mistress’s honour. “Now when they saw him they seized him
(continued she), crying:—A thief! and brought him before thee,
whereupon he confessed to the robbery and persisted in his confession,
that he might spare me disgrace; and this he did, making
himself a thief, of the exceeding nobility and generosity of his
nature.” Khalid answered, “He is indeed worthy to have his
desire;” and, calling the young man to him, kissed him between
the eyes. Then he sent for the girl’s father and bespoke him,
saying, “O Shaykh, we thought to carry out the law of mutilation
in the case of this young man; but Allah (to whom be Honour
and Glory!) hath preserved us from this, and I now adjudge him
the sum of ten thousand dirhams, for that he would have given
his hand for the preservation of thine honour and that of thy
daughter and for the sparing of shame to you both. Moreover,
<span class="pageno" id="Page_159">159</span>I adjudge other ten thousand dirhams to thy daughter, for that
she made known to me the truth of the case; and I ask thy
leave to marry her to him.” Rejoined the old man, “O Emir,
thou hast my consent.” So Khalid praised Allah and thanked
Him and improved the occasion by preaching a goodly sermon
and a prayerful;——And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day
and ceased saying her permitted say.</p>

<p class="c000">She said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that Khalid
praised Allah and thanked Him and improved the occasion by
preaching a goodly sermon and a prayerful; after which he said
to the young man, “I give thee to wife the damsel, such an one
here present, with her own permission and her father’s consent;
and her wedding settlement shall be this money, to wit, ten thousand
dirhams.” “I accept this marriage at thy hands,” replied the
youth; and Khalid bade them carry the money on brass trays in
procession to the young man’s house, whilst the people dispersed,
fully satisfied. “And surely (quoth he who tells the tale<a id="r223"></a><a href="#f223" class="c014"><sup>[223]</sup></a>) never
saw I a rarer day than this, for that it began with tears and annoy;

  <h2 id="c159" class="c007">JA’AFAR THE BARMECIDE AND THE BEAN-SELLER.</h2>
</div>

<p class="c013">When Harun al-Rashid crucified Ja’afar the Barmecide<a id="r224"></a><a href="#f224" class="c014"><sup>[224]</sup></a> he commanded
that all who wept or made moan for him should also be
crucified; so the folk abstained from that. Now it chanced that a
wild Arab, who dwelt in a distant wold, used every year to bring to
<span class="pageno" id="Page_160">160</span>the aforesaid Ja’afar an ode<a id="r225"></a><a href="#f225" class="c014"><sup>[225]</sup></a> in his honour, for which he rewarded
him with a thousand dinars; and the Badawi took them and, returning
to his own country, lived upon them, he and his family,
for the rest of the year. Accordingly, he came with his ode at the
wonted time and, finding that Ja’afar had been crucified, betook
himself to the place where his body was hanging, and there made
his camel kneel down and wept with sore weeping and mourned
with grievous mourning; and he recited his ode and fell asleep.
Presently Ja’afar the Barmecide appeared to him in a vision and
said, “Verily thou hast wearied thyself to come to us and findest
us as thou seest; but go to Bassorah and ask for a man there
whose name is such and such, one of the merchants of the town,
and say to him:—Ja’afar, the Barmecide, saluteth thee and biddeth
thee give me a thousand dinars, by the token of the bean.” Now
when the wild Arab awoke, he repaired to Bassorah, where he
sought out the merchant and found him and repeated to him what
Ja’afar had said in the dream; whereupon he wept with weeping
so sore that he was like to depart the world. Then he welcomed
the Badawi and seated him by his side and made his stay pleasant
and entertained him three days as an honoured guest; and when
he was minded to depart he gave him a thousand and five hundred
dinars, saying, “The thousand are what is commanded to thee,
and the five hundred are a gift from me to thee; and every year
thou shalt have of me a thousand gold pieces.” Now when the
Arab was about to take leave, he said to the merchant, “Allah
upon thee, tell me the story of the bean, that I may know the
origin of all this.” He answered:—In the early part of my life I
was poor and hawked hot beans<a id="r226"></a><a href="#f226" class="c014"><sup>[226]</sup></a> about the streets of Baghdad to
<span class="pageno" id="Page_161">161</span>keep me alive. So I went out one raw and rainy day, without
clothes enough on my body to protect me from the weather; now
shivering for excess of cold and now stumbling into the pools of
rain-water, and altogether in so piteous a plight as would make
me shudder with goose-skin to look upon. But it chanced that
Ja’afar that day was seated with his officers and his concubines, in
an upper chamber overlooking the street when his eyes fell on me;
so he took pity on my case and, sending one of his dependents to
fetch me to him, said as soon as he saw me, “Sell thy beans to
my people.” So I began to mete out the beans with a measure I
had by me; and each who took a measure of beans filled the
measure with gold pieces till all my store was gone and my basket
was clean empty. Then I gathered together the gold I had gotten,
and Ja’afar said to me, “Hast thou any beans left?” “I know not,”
answered I, and then sought in the basket, but found only one
bean. So Ja’afar took from me the single bean and, splitting it
in twain, kept one half himself and gave the other to one of his
concubines, saying, “For how much wilt thou buy this half bean?”
She replied, “For the tale of all this gold twice-told;” whereat I
was confounded and said to myself, “This is impossible.” But, as
I stood wondering, behold, she gave an order to one of her handmaids
and the girl brought me the sum of the collected monies
twice-told. Then said Ja’afar, “And I will buy the half I have by
me for double the sum of the whole,” presently adding, “Now take
the price of thy bean.” And he gave an order to one of his servants,
who gathered together the whole of the money and laid it
in my basket; and I took it and went my ways. Then I betook
myself to Bassorah, where I traded with the monies and Allah
prospered me amply, to Him be the praise and the thanks! So, if
I give thee every year a thousand dinars of the bounty of Ja’afar,
it will in no wise injure me. Consider then the munificence of
Ja’afar’s nature and how he was praised both alive and dead, the
mercy of Allah Almighty be upon him! And men also recount
the tale of</p>

The story in the text is also variously told and the Persian “Nigáristán” adds
some unpleasant comments upon the House of Abbas. The Persians, for reasons which
will be explained in the terminal Essay, show the greatest sympathy with the Barmecides;
and abominate the Abbasides even more than the latter detested the Ommiades.</p>

<p class="c000"><span class="label"><a href="#r226">226</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Arab. “Fúl al-hárr” = beans like horsebeans soaked and boiled as opposed to the
“Fúl Mudammas” (esp. of Egypt) = unshelled beans steamed and boiled all night and
eaten with linseed oil as “kitchen” or relish. Lane (M. E., chapt. v.) calls them after
the debased Cairene pronunciation, Mudemmes. A legend says that, before the days of
Pharaoh (always he of Moses), the Egyptians lived on pistachios which made them a
witty, lively race. But the tyrant remarking that the domestic ass, which eats beans, is
degenerate from the wild ass, uprooted the pistachio-trees and compelled the lieges to
feed on beans which made them a heavy, gross, cowardly people fit only for burdens.
Badawis deride “bean-eaters” although they do not loathe the pulse like onions. The
principal result of a bean diet is an extraordinary development of flatulence both in
stomach and intestines: hence, possibly, Pythagoras who had studied ceremonial purity
in Egypt, forbade the use, unless he referred to venery or political business. I was once
sitting in the Greek quarter of Cairo dressed as a Moslem when arose a prodigious
hubbub of lads and boys, surrounding a couple of Fellahs. These men had been working
in the fields about a mile east of Cairo; and, when returning home, one had said to the
other, “If thou wilt carry the hoes I will break wind once for every step we take.” He
was as good as his word and when they were to part he cried, “And now for thy
bakhshish!” which consisted of a volley of fifty, greatly to the delight of the boys.</p>

<p class="c013">It is told that Harun al-Rashid was sitting one day on the
throne of the Caliphate, when there came in to him a youth of
his eunuchry, bearing a crown of red gold, set with pearls and
rubies and all manner of other gems and jewels, such as money
might not buy; and, bussing the ground between his hands, said,
“O Commander of the Faithful, the Lady Zubaydah kisseth the
earth before thee”——And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day
and ceased to say her permitted say. Whereupon quoth her sister
Dunyazad, “How pleasant is thy tale and profitable; and how
sweet is thy speech and how delectable!” “And where is this,” replied
Shahrazad, “compared with what I shall tell you next night
an I live and the King grant me leave!” Thereupon quoth the
King to himself, “By Allah, I will not slay her until I hear the
end of her tale.”</p>

she replied, “With joy and good will, if the King accord me leave;”
whereupon the King said, “Tell thy tale, O Shahrazad.” So she
pursued:—It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that the youth
said to the Caliph, “The Lady Zubaydah kisseth the earth before
thee and saith to thee, Thou knowest she hath bidden make this
crown, which lacketh a great jewel for its dome-top; and she hath
made search among her treasures, but cannot find a jewel of size
to suit her mind.” Quoth the Caliph to his Chamberlains and
Viceregents, “Make search for a great jewel, such as Zubaydah
desireth.” So they sought, but found nothing befitting her and
told the Caliph who, vexed and annoyed thereat, exclaimed,
“How am I Caliph and King of the Kings of the earth and
cannot find so small a matter as a jewel? Woe to you! Ask of
the merchants.” So they enquired of the traders, who replied,
“Our lord the Caliph will not find a jewel such as he requireth
save with a man of Bassorah, by name Abú Mohammed hight
Lazybones.” Thereupon they acquainted the Caliph with this
and he bade his Wazir Ja’afar send a note to the Emir Mohammed
<span class="pageno" id="Page_163">163</span>al-Zubaydí, Governor of Bassorah, commanding him to equip Abu
Mohammed Lazybones and bring him into the presence of the
Commander of the Faithful. The Minister accordingly wrote a
note to that effect and despatched it by Masrur, who set out forthright
for the city of Bassorah, and went in to the Emir Mohammed
al-Zubaydi, who rejoiced in him and treated him with the highmost
honour. Then Masrur read him the mandate of the Prince
of True Believers, Harun al-Rashid, to which he replied, “I hear
and I obey,” and forthwith despatched him, with a company of
his followers, to Abu Mohammed’s house. When they reached it,
they knocked at the door, whereupon a page came out and Masrur
said to him, “Tell thy lord, The Commander of the Faithful
summoneth thee.” The servant went in and told his master, who
came out and found Masrur, the Caliph’s Chamberlain, and a
company of the Governor’s men at the door. So he kissed ground
before Masrur and said, “I hear and obey the summons of the
Commander of the Faithful; but first enter ye my house.” They
replied, “We cannot do that, save in haste; even as the Prince
of True Believers commanded us, for he awaiteth thy coming.”
But he said, “Have patience with me a little, till I set my affairs
in order.” So after much pressure and abundant persuasion, they
entered the house with him and found the vestibule hung with
curtains of azure brocade, purfled with red gold, and Abu
Mohammed Lazybones bade one of his servants carry Masrur to
the private Hammam. Now this bath was in the house and
Masrur found its walls and floors of rare and precious marbles,
wrought with gold and silver, and its waters mingled with rose-water.
Then the servants served Masrur and his company with
the perfection of service; and, on their going forth of the
Hammam, clad them in robes of honour, brocade-work interwoven
with gold. And after leaving the bath Masrur and his men
went in to Abu Mohammed Lazybones and found him seated in
his upper chamber; and over his head hung curtains of gold-brocade,
wrought with pearls and jewels, and the pavilion was
spread with cushions, embroidered in red gold. Now the owner
was sitting softly upon a quilted cloth covering a settee inlaid
with stones of price; and, when he saw Masrur, he went forward
to meet him and bidding him welcome, seated him by his side.
Then he called for the food-trays; so they brought them, and
when Masrur saw the tables, he exclaimed, “By Allah, never did
I behold the like of these appointments in the palace of the
<span class="pageno" id="Page_164">164</span>Commander of the Faithful!” For indeed the trays contained
every manner of meat all served in dishes of gilded porcelain.<a id="r227"></a><a href="#f227" class="c014"><sup>[227]</sup></a>
So we ate and drank and made merry till the end of the day
(quoth Masrur) when the host gave to each and every of us five
thousand dinars; and on the morrow he clad us in dresses of
honour of green and gold and entreated us with the utmost
worship. Then said Masrur to him, “We can tarry no longer for
fear of the Caliph’s displeasure.” Answered Abu Mohammed
Lazybones, “O my lord, have patience with us till the morrow,
that we may equip ourselves, and we will then depart with you.”
So they tarried with him that day and slept the night; and next
morning Abu Mohammed’s servants saddled him a she-mule with
selle and trappings of gold, set with all manner of pearls and
stones of price; whereupon quoth Masrur to himself, “I wonder
when Abu Mohammed shall present himself in such equipage, if
the Caliph will ask him how he came by all this wealth.” Thereupon
they took leave of Al-Zubaydi and, setting out from
Bassorah, fared on, without ceasing to fare till they reached
Baghdad-city and presented themselves before the Caliph, who
bade Abu Mohammed be seated. He sat down and addressed
the Caliph in courtly phrase, saying, “O Commander of the
Faithful, I have brought with me an humble offering by way of
homage: have I thy gracious permission to produce it?” Al-Rashid
replied, “There is no harm in that,”<a id="r228"></a><a href="#f228" class="c014"><sup>[228]</sup></a> whereupon Abu Mohammed
bade his men bring in a chest, from which he took a number of
rarities, and amongst the rest, trees of gold with leaves of white
emerald,<a id="r229"></a><a href="#f229" class="c014"><sup>[229]</sup></a> and fruits of pigeon-blood rubies and topazes and new
pearls and bright. And as the Caliph was struck with admiration
he fetched a second chest and brought out of it a tent of brocade,
crowned with pearls and jacinths and emeralds and jaspers and other
precious stones; its poles were of freshly-cut Hindi aloes-wood,
<span class="pageno" id="Page_165">165</span>and its skirts were set with the greenest smaragds. Thereon were
depicted all manner of animals such as beasts and birds, spangled
with precious stones, rubies, emeralds, chrysolites and balasses and
every kind of precious metal. Now when Al-Rashid saw these things,
he rejoiced with exceeding joy and Abu Mohammed Lazybones
said to him, “O Commander of the Faithful, deem not that I have
brought these to thee, fearing aught or coveting anything; but I
knew myself to be but a man of the people and that such things
befitted none save the Commander of the Faithful. And now, with
thy leave, I will show thee, for thy diversion, something of what I
can do.” Al-Rashid replied, “Do what thou wilt, that we may
see.” “To hear is to obey,” said Abu Mohammed and, moving his
lips, beckoned the palace battlements,<a id="r230"></a><a href="#f230" class="c014"><sup>[230]</sup></a> whereupon they inclined to
him; then he made another sign to them, and they returned to
their place. Presently he made a sign with his eye, and there
appeared before him closets with closed doors, to which he spoke,
and lo! the voices of birds answered him from within. The Caliph
marvelled with passing marvel at this and said to him, “How
camest thou by all this, seeing that thou art known only as Abu
Mohammed Lazybones, and they tell me that thy father was a
cupper, serving in a public Hammam, who left thee nothing?”
Whereupon he answered, Listen to my story——And Shahrazad
perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted
say.</p>

    <div>Now when it was the Three Hundred and First Night,</div>
  </div>
</div>

</div>

<p class="c000">She said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that Abu
Mohammed Lazybones thus spake to the Caliph:—O Prince of
True Believers, listen to my story, for it is a marvellous and
its particulars are wondrous; were it graven with graver-needles
upon the eye-corners it were a warner to whoso would be warned.
Quoth Al-Rashid, “Let us hear all thou hast to say, O Abu
Mohammed!” So he began:—Know then, O Commander of
the Faithful (Allah prolong to thee glory and dominion!), the
report of the folk, that I am known as the Lazybones and that
my father left me nothing, is true; for he was, as thou hast said,
nothing but a barber-cupper in a Hammam. And I throughout
<span class="pageno" id="Page_166">166</span>my youth was the idlest wight on the face of the earth; indeed,
so great was my sluggishness that, if I lay at full length in the
sultry season and the sun came round upon me, I was too lazy to
rise and remove from the sun to the shade. And thus I abode till
I reached my fifteenth year, when my father deceased in the mercy
of Allah Almighty and left me nothing. However, my mother
used to go out a-charing and feed me and give me to drink, whilst
I lay on my side. Now it came to pass that one day she came in
to me with five silver dirhams, and said to me, “O my son, I hear
that Shaykh Abú al-Muzaffar<a id="r231"></a><a href="#f231" class="c014"><sup>[231]</sup></a> is about to go a voyage to China.”
(Now this Shaykh was a good and charitable man who loved the
poor.) “So come, O my son, take these five silver bits; and let
us both carry them to him and beg him to buy thee therewith
somewhat from the land of China; so haply thou mayst make a
profit of it by the bounty of Allah, whose name be exalted!” I
was too idle to move for her; but she swore by the Almighty
that, except I rose and went with her, she would bring me neither
meat nor drink nor come in to me, but would leave me to die of
hunger and thirst. Now when I heard her words, O Commander
of the Faithful, I knew she would do as she threatened for her
knowledge of my sluggishness; so I said to her, “Help me to sit
up.” She did so, and I wept the while and said to her, “Bring
me my shoes.” Accordingly, she brought them and I said, “Put
them on my feet.” She put them on my feet and I said, “Lift me
up off the ground.” So she lifted me up and I said, “Support me,
that I may walk.” So she supported me and I continued to fare
a-foot, at times stumbling over my skirts, till we came to the river-bank,
where we saluted the Shaykh and I said to him, “O my
uncle, art thou Abu al-Muzaffar?” “At thy service,” answered
he, and I, “Take these dirhams and with them buy me somewhat
from the land of China: haply Allah may vouchsafe me a profit
of it.” Quoth the Shaykh to his companions, “Do ye know this
youth?” They answered, “Yes, he is known as Abu Mohammed
Lazybones, and we never saw him stir from his house till this
moment.” Then said he to me, “O my son, give me the silver
with the blessing of Almighty Allah!” So he took the money,
saying, “Bismillah—in the name of Allah!”—and I returned home
with my mother. Presently Shaykh Abu al-Muzaffar set sail, with
a company of merchants, and stayed not till they reached the land
<span class="pageno" id="Page_167">167</span>of China, where he and his bought and sold; and, having won
what they wished, set out on their homeward voyage. When they
had been three days at sea, the Shaykh said to his company, “Stay
the vessel!” They asked, “What dost thou want?” and he answered,
“Know that I have forgotten the commission wherewith
Abu Mohammed Lazybones charged me; so let us turn back that
we may lay out his money on somewhat whereby he may profit.”
They cried, “We conjure thee, by Allah Almighty turn not back
with us; for we have traversed a long distance and a sore, and
while so doing we have endured sad hardship and many terrors.”
Quoth he, “There is no help for it but we return;” and they
said, “Take from us double the profit of the five dirhams, and
turn us not back.” He agreed to this and they collected for
him an ample sum of money. Thereupon they sailed on, till they
came to an island wherein was much people; when they moored
thereto and the merchants went ashore, to buy thence a stock of
precious metals and pearls and jewels and so forth. Presently
Abu al-Muzaffar saw a man seated, with many apes before
him, and amongst them one whose hair had been plucked off;
and as often as their owner’s attention was diverted from
them, the other apes fell upon the plucked one and beat him
and threw him on their master; whereupon the man rose and
bashed them and bound them and punished them for this; and
all the apes were wroth with the plucked ape on this account
and tunded him the more. When Shaykh Abu al-Muzaffar saw
this, he felt for and took compassion upon the plucked ape and
said to his master, “Wilt thou sell me yonder monkey?” Replied
the man, “Buy,” and Abu al-Muzaffar rejoined, “I have with me
five dirhams, belonging to an orphan lad. Wilt thou sell it me
for that sum?” Answered the monkey-merchant, “It is a bargain;
and Allah give thee a blessing of him!” So he made over
the beast and received his money; and the Shaykh’s slaves took
the ape and tied him up in the ship. Then they loosed sail and
made for another island, where they cast anchor; and there came
down divers, who plunged for precious stones, pearls and other
gems; so the merchants hired them to dive for money and they
dived. Now when the ape saw them doing this, he loosed himself
from his bonds and, jumping off the ship’s side, plunged with them,
whereupon quoth Abu al-Muzaffar, “There is no Majesty and
there is no Might, save in Allah, the Glorious, the Great! The
monkey is lost to us with the luck of the poor fellow for whom we
<span class="pageno" id="Page_168">168</span>bought him.” And they despaired of him; but, after a while, the
company of divers rose to the surface, and behold, among them
was the ape, with his hands full of jewels of price, which he threw
down before Abu al-Muzaffar. The Shaykh marvelled at this and
said, “There is much mystery in this monkey!” Then they cast
off and sailed till they came to a third island, called the Isle of the
Zunúj,<a id="r232"></a><a href="#f232" class="c014"><sup>[232]</sup></a> who are a people of the blacks, which eat the flesh of the
sons of Adam. When the blacks saw them, they boarded them in
dug-outs<a id="r233"></a><a href="#f233" class="c014"><sup>[233]</sup></a> and, taking all in the vessel, pinioned them and carried
them to their King, who bade slaughter certain of the merchants.
So they slaughtered them by cutting their throats and ate their
flesh; and the rest of the traders passed the night in bonds and
were in sore concern. But when it was midnight, the ape arose
and going up to Abu al-Muzaffar, loosed his bonds; and, as the
others saw him free, they said, “Allah grant our deliverance may
be at thy hands, O Abu al-Muzaffar!” But he replied, “Know,
that he who delivered me, by leave of Allah Almighty, was none
other than this monkey”——And Shahrazad perceived the dawn
of day and ceased to say her permitted say.</p>

<div>

<div class="nf-center-c1">
<div class="nf-center c005">
    <div>Now when it was the Three Hundred and Second Night,</div>
  </div>
</div>

</div>

<p class="c000">She said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that Abu
al-Muzaffar declared, “None loosed me, by leave of Allah Almighty,
save this monkey and I buy my release of him at a
thousand dinars;” whereupon the merchants rejoined, “And we
likewise, each and every, will pay him a thousand dinars if he
<span class="pageno" id="Page_169">169</span>release us.” With this the ape arose and went up to them and
loosed their bonds one by one, till he had freed them all, when
they made for the vessel and boarding her, found all safe and
nothing missing from her. So they cast off and set sail; and
presently Abu al-Muzaffar said to them, “O merchants, fulfil your
promise to the monkey.” “We hear and we obey,” answered
they; and each one paid him one thousand dinars, whilst Abu
al-Muzaffar brought out to him the like sum of his own monies, so
that a great heap of coin was collected for the ape. Then they
fared on till they reached Bassorah-city where their friends came
out to meet them; and when they had landed the Shaykh said,
“Where is Abu Mohammed Lazybones?” The news reached my
mother, who came to me as I lay asleep and said to me, “O my
son, verily the Shaykh Abu al-Muzaffar hath come back and is now
in the city; so rise and go thou to him and salute him and enquire
what he hath brought thee; it may be Allah Almighty have
opened to thee the door of fortune with somewhat.” Quoth I,
“Lift me from the ground and prop me up, whilst I go forth and
walk to the river-bank.” After which I went out and walked on,
stumbling over my skirts, till I met the Shaykh, who exclaimed at
sight of me, “Welcome to him whose money hath been the means
of my release and that of these merchants, by the will of Almighty
Allah.” Then he continued, “Take this monkey I bought for thee
and carry him home and wait till I come to thee.” So I took the
ape and went off, saying in my mind, “By Allah, this is naught
but rare merchandise!” and led it home, where I said to my
mother, “Whenever I lie down to sleep, thou biddest me rise and
trade; see now this merchandise with thine own eyes.” Then I
sat me down and as I sat, up came the slaves of Abu al-Muzaffar
and said to me, “Art thou Abu Mohammed Lazybones?” “Yes”
answered I; and behold, Abu al-Muzaffar appeared behind them.
So I rose up to him and kissed his hands: and he said, “Come
with me to my home.” “Hearkening and obedience,” answered
I and accompanied him to his house, where he bade his servants
bring me what money the monkey had earned for me. So they
brought it and he said to me, “O my son, Allah hath blessed thee
with this wealth, by way of profit on thy five dirhams.” Then the
slaves set down the treasure in chests, which they had carried on
their heads, and Abu al-Muzaffar gave me the keys saying, “Go
before the slaves to thy house; for in sooth all this wealth is
thine.” So I returned to my mother, who rejoiced in this and
<span class="pageno" id="Page_170">170</span>said to me, “O my son, Allah hath blessed thee with all these
riches; so put off thy laziness and go down to the bazar and sell
and buy.” At once I shook off my dull sloth, and opened a shop
in the bazar, where the ape used to sit on the same divan with me,
eating with me when I ate and drinking when I drank. But, every
day, he was absent from dawn till noon, when he came back bringing
with him a purse of a thousand dinars, which he laid by my
side, and sat down; and he ceased not so doing for a great while,
till I amassed much wealth, wherewith, O Commander of the
Faithful, I purchased houses and lands, and I planted gardens and
I bought me white slaves and negroes and concubines. Now it
came to pass one day, as I sat in my shop, with the ape sitting at
my side on the same carpet, behold, he began to turn right and
left, and I said to myself, “What aileth the beast?” Then
Allah made the ape speak with a ready tongue, and he said to
me, “O Abu Mohammed!” Now when I heard him speak, I
was sore afraid; but he said to me, “Fear not; I will tell thee
my case. I am a Marid of the Jinn and came to thee because
of thy poor estate; but to-day thou knowest not the amount of
thy wealth; and now I have need of thee and if thou do my
will, it shall be well for thee.” I asked, “What is it?” and he
answered, “I have a mind to marry thee to a girl like the full
moon.” Quoth I, “How so?”; and quoth he, “To-morrow don thou
thy richest dress and mount thy mule, with the saddle of gold,
and ride to the Haymarket. There enquire for the shop of the
Sharif<a id="r234"></a><a href="#f234" class="c014"><sup>[234]</sup></a> and sit down beside him and say to him:—I come to thee
as a suitor craving thy daughter’s hand. If he say to thee:—Thou
hast neither cash nor rank nor family; pull out a thousand
dinars and give them to him, and if he ask more, give
him more and tempt him with money.” Whereto I replied,
“To hear is to obey; I will do thy bidding, Inshallah!” So on
the next morning I donned my richest clothes, mounted my she-mule
with trappings of gold and rode to the Haymarket where
I asked for the Sharif’s shop; and finding him there seated,
alighted and saluted him and seated myself beside him——And
Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her
permitted say.</p>

    <div>Now when it was the Three Hundred and Third Night,</div>
  </div>
</div>

</div>

<p class="c000">She said, it hath reached me, O auspicious King, that Abu
Mohammed Lazybones continued:—So I alighted and, saluting
him seated myself beside him and my Mamelukes and negro-slaves
stood before me. Said the Sharif, “Haply, thou hast
some business with us which we may have pleasure of transacting?”
Replied I, “Yes, I have business with thee.” Asked
he, “And what is it?”; and I answered, “I come to thee as a
suitor for thy daughter’s hand.” So he said, “Thou hast neither
cash nor rank nor family;” whereupon I pulled him out a purse
of a thousand dinars, red gold, and said to him, “This is my rank<a id="r235"></a><a href="#f235" class="c014"><sup>[235]</sup></a>
and my family”; and he (whom Allah bless and keep!) hath said:—The
best of ranks is wealth. And how well quoth the poet:—</p>

<div class="lg-container-b c003">
  <div class="linegroup">
    <div class="group">
      <div class="line">Whoso two dirhams hath, his lips have learnt ✿ Speech of all kinds with eloquence bedight:</div>
      <div class="line">Draw near<a id="r236"></a><a href="#f236" class="c014"><sup>[236]</sup></a> his brethren and crave ear of him, ✿ And him thou seest haught in pride-full height:</div>
      <div class="line">Were’t not for dirhams wherein glories he, ✿ Hadst found him ‘mid mankind in sorry plight.</div>
      <div class="line">When richard errs in words they all reply, ✿ “Sooth thou hast spoken and hast said aright!.”</div>
      <div class="line">When pauper speaketh truly all reply ✿ “Thou liest;” and they hold his sayings light.<a id="r237"></a><a href="#f237" class="c014"><sup>[237]</sup></a></div>

      <div class="line">Gold is the very tongue of eloquence; ✿ Gold is the best of arms for wight who’d fight!”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class="c000">Now when the Sharif heard these my words and understood my
verse, he bowed his head awhile groundwards then raising it,
said, “If it must be so, I will have of thee other three thousand
gold pieces.” “I hear and I obey,” answered I, and sent one
of my Mamelukes home for the money. As soon as he came
back with it, I handed it to the Sharif who, when he saw it in
<span class="pageno" id="Page_172">172</span>his hands, rose and bidding his servants shut his shop, invited
his brother merchants of the bazar to the wedding; after which
he carried me to his house and wrote out my contract of marriage
with his daughter saying to me, “After ten days, I will bring thee
to pay her the first visit.” So I went home rejoicing and, shutting
myself up with the ape, told him what had passed; and he said
“Thou hast done well.” Now when the time appointed by the
Sharif drew near, the ape said to me, “There is a thing I would
have thee do for me; and thou shalt have of me (when it is done)
whatso thou wilt.” I asked, “What is that?” and he answered,
“At the upper end of the chamber wherein thou shalt meet thy
bride, the Sharif’s daughter, stands a cabinet, on whose door is a
ring-padlock of copper and the keys under it. Take the keys
and open the cabinet in which thou shalt find a coffer of iron
with four flags, which are talismans, at its corners; and in its
midst stands a brazen basin full of money, wherein is tied a white
cock with a cleft comb; while on one side of the coffer are eleven
serpents and on the other a knife. Take the knife and slaughter
the cock; cut away the flags and upset the chest, then go back
to the bride and do away her maidenhead. This is what I have
to ask of thee.” “Hearkening and obedience,” answered I, and
betook myself to the house of the Sharif. So as soon as I entered
the bride-chamber, I looked for the cabinet and found it even as
the ape had described it. Then I went in unto the bride and marvelled
at her beauty and loveliness and stature and symmetrical
grace, for indeed they were such as no tongue can set forth. I
rejoiced in her with exceeding joy; and in the middle of the
night, when my bride slept, I rose and, taking the keys, opened
the cabinet. Then I seized the knife and slew the cock and threw
down the flags and upset the coffer, whereupon the girl awoke
and, seeing the closet open and the cock with cut throat, exclaimed,
“There is no Majesty and there is no Might save in
Allah, the Glorious, the Great! The Marid hath got hold of
me!” Hardly had she made an end of speaking, when the
Marid swooped down upon the house and, snatching up the
bride, flew away with her; whereupon there arose a mighty
clamour and behold, in came the Sharif, buffetting his face and
crying, “O Abu Mohammed, what is this deed thou hast done?
Is it thus thou requitest us? I made this talisman in the cabinet
fearing for my daughter from this accursed one who, for these six
years, hath sought to steal away the girl, but could not. But
<span class="pageno" id="Page_173">173</span>now there is no more abiding for thee with us; so wend thy ways.”
Thereupon I went forth and returned to my own house, where I
made search for the ape but could not find him nor any trace of
him; whereby I knew that it was he who was the Marid, and that
he had carried off my wife and had tricked me into destroying the
talisman and the cock, the two things which hindered him from
taking her, and I repented, rending my raiment and cuffing my
face. And there was no land but was straitened upon me; so I
made for the desert forthright and ceased not wandering on till
night overtook me, for I knew not whither I was going. And
whilst I was deep in sad thought behold, I met two serpents, one
tawny and the other white, and they were fighting to kill each
other. So I took up a stone and with one cast slew the tawny
serpent, which was the aggressor; whereupon the white serpent
glided away and was absent for a while, but presently she returned
accompanied by ten other white serpents which glided up to the
dead serpent and tore her in pieces, so that only the head was
left. Then they went their ways and I fell prostrate for weariness
on the ground where I stood; but as I lay, pondering my case lo!
I heard a Voice though I saw no one and the Voice versified with
these two couplets:—</p>

<div class="lg-container-b c003">
  <div class="linegroup">
    <div class="group">
      <div class="line">Let Fate with slackened bridle fare her pace, ✿ Nor pass the night with mind which cares an ace.</div>
      <div class="line">Between eye-closing and its opening, ✿ Allah can foulest change to fairest case.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class="c000">Now when I heard this, O Commander of the Faithful, great
concern gat hold of me and I was beyond measure troubled; and
behold, I heard a Voice from behind me extemporise these
couplets:—</p>

<div class="lg-container-b c003">
  <div class="linegroup">
    <div class="group">
      <div class="line">O Moslem! thou whose guide is Alcorán, ✿ Joy in what brought safe peace to thee, O man.</div>
      <div class="line">Fear not what Satan haply whispered thee, ✿ And in us see a Truth-believing clan.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class="c000">Then said I, “I conjure thee, by the truth of Him thou worshippest,
let me know who thou art!” Thereupon the Invisible
Speaker assumed the form of a man and said, “Fear not; for the
report of thy good deed hath reached us, and we are a people of
the true-believing Jinn. So, if thou lack aught, let us know it,
that we may have the pleasure of fulfilling thy want.” Quoth I,
“Indeed I am in sore need, for I am afflicted with a grievous
<span class="pageno" id="Page_174">174</span>affliction and no one was ever afflicted as I am!” Quoth he,
“Perchance thou art Abu Mohammed Lazybones?” and I
replied, “Yes.” He rejoined, “I, O Abu Mohammed, am the
brother of the white serpent, whose foe thou slewest; we are four
brothers by one father and mother, and we are all indebted to
thee for thy kindness. And know thou that he who played this
trick on thee in the likeness of an ape, is a Marid of the Marids of
the Jinn; and had he not used this artifice, he had never been
able to get the girl; for he hath loved her and had a mind to take
her this long while, but he was hindered of that talisman; and
had it remained as it was, he could never have found access to
her. However, fret not thyself for that; we will bring thee to her
and kill the Marid; for thy kindness is not lost upon us.” Then
he cried out with a terrible outcry——And Shahrazad perceived
the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say.</p>

<div class="nf-center-c1">

<p class="c000">She said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that the Ifrit
continued, “Verily thy kindness is not lost upon us.” Then he
cried out with a terrible outcry in a horrible voice, and behold,
there appeared a troop of the Jinn, of whom he enquired concerning
the ape; and one of them said, “I know his abiding-place;”
and the other asked “Where abideth he?” Said the speaker “He
is in the City of Brass whereon sun riseth not.” Then said the
first Jinni to me, “O Abu Mohammed, take one of these our
slaves, and he will carry thee on his back and teach thee how thou
shalt get back the girl; but know that this slave is a Marid of the
Marids and beware, whilst he is carrying thee, lest thou utter the
name of Allah, or he will flee from thee and thou wilt fall and be
destroyed.” “I hear and obey,” answered I and chose out one of
the slaves, who bent down and said to me, “Mount.” So I
mounted on his back, and he flew up with me into the firmament,
till I lost sight of the earth and saw the stars as they were the
mountains of earth fixed and firm<a id="r238"></a><a href="#f238" class="c014"><sup>[238]</sup></a> and heard the angels crying,
<span class="pageno" id="Page_175">175</span>“Praise be to Allah,” in heaven while the Marid held me in converse,
diverting me and hindering me from pronouncing the name
of Almighty Allah.<a id="r239"></a><a href="#f239" class="c014"><sup>[239]</sup></a> But, as we flew, behold, One clad in green
raiment,<a id="r240"></a><a href="#f240" class="c014"><sup>[240]</sup></a> with streaming tresses and radiant face, holding in his
hand a javelin whence flew sparks of fire, accosted me, saying, “O
Abu Mohammed, say:—There is no god but <em>the</em> God and
Mohammed is the Apostle of God; or I will smite thee with
this javelin.” Now already I felt heart-broken by my forced
silence as regards calling on the name of Allah; so I said, “There
is no god but <em>the</em> God, and Mohammed is the Apostle of God.”
Whereupon the shining One smote the Marid with his javelin and
he melted away and became ashes; whilst I was thrown from his
back and fell headlong towards the earth, till I dropped into the
midst of a dashing sea, swollen with clashing surge. And behold,
I fell hard by a ship with five sailors therein, who seeing me, made
for me and took me up into the vessel; and they began to speak
to me in some speech I knew not; but I signed to them that I
understood not their speech. So they fared on till the last of the
day, when they cast out a net and caught a great fish and they
broiled it and gave me to eat; after which they ceased not sailing
on till they reached their city and carried me to their King
and set me in his presence. So I kissed ground before him, and
he bestowed on me a dress of honour and said to me in Arabic
(which he knew well), “I appoint thee one of my officers.”
Thereupon I asked him the name of the city, and he replied, “It
is called Hanád<a id="r241"></a><a href="#f241" class="c014"><sup>[241]</sup></a> and is in the land of China.” Then he committed
me to his Wazir, bidding him show me the city, which
was formerly peopled by Infidels, till Almighty Allah turned
them into stones; and there I abode a month’s space, diverting
myself with viewing the place, nor saw I ever greater plenty of
trees and fruits than there. And when this time had past, one
<span class="pageno" id="Page_176">176</span>day, as I sat on the bank of a river, behold, there accosted me
a horseman, who said to me, “Art thou not Abu Mohammed
Lazybones?” “Yes,” answered I; whereupon, he said, “Fear
not, for the report of thy good deed hath reached us.” Asked
I, “Who art thou?” and he answered, “I am a brother of the white
serpent, and thou art hard by the place where is the damsel whom
thou seekest.” So saying, he took off his clothes and clad me
therein, saying, “Fear not, for the slave who perished under thee
was one of our slaves.” Then the horseman took me up behind
him and rode on with me to a desert place, when he said,
“Dismount now and walk on between these two mountains, till
thou seest the City of Brass;<a id="r242"></a><a href="#f242" class="c014"><sup>[242]</sup></a> then halt afar off and enter it not,
ere I return to thee and tell thee how thou shalt do.” “To hear
is to obey,” replied I and, dismounting from behind him, walked
on till I came to the city, the walls whereof I found of brass.
Then I began to pace round about it, hoping to find a gate, but
found none; and presently as I persevered behold, the serpent’s
brother rejoined me and gave me a charmed sword which should
hinder any from seeing me,<a id="r243"></a><a href="#f243" class="c014"><sup>[243]</sup></a> then went his way. Now he had
been gone but a little while, when lo! I heard a noise of cries
and found myself in the midst of a multitude of folk whose eyes
were in their breasts; and seeing me quoth they, “Who art thou,
and what cast thee into this place?” So I told them my story,
and they said, “The girl thou seekest is in this city with the
Marid; but we know not what he hath done with her. Now we
are brethren of the white serpent,” adding, “Go thou to yonder
spring and note where the water entereth, and enter thou with
it; for it will bring thee into the city.” I did as they bade me,
and followed the water-course, till it brought me to a Sardáb, a
vaulted room under the earth, from which I ascended and found
myself in the midst of the city. Here I saw the damsel seated
<span class="pageno" id="Page_177">177</span>upon a throne of gold, under a canopy of brocade, girt round by
a garden full of trees of gold, whose fruits were jewels of price,
such as rubies and chrysolites, pearls and coral. And the
moment she saw me, she knew me and accosted me with the
Moslem salutation, saying, “O my lord, who guided thee hither?”
So I told her all that had passed, and she said, “Know, that the
accursed Marid, of the greatness of his love for me, hath told me
what bringeth him bane and what bringeth him gain; and that
there is here a talisman by means whereof he could, an he would,
destroy the city and all that are therein; and whoso possesseth
it, the Ifrits will do his commandment in everything. It standeth
upon a pillar”—Whereat I asked her, “And where is the pillar?”
and she answered, “It is in such a place.” “And what manner of
thing may the talisman be?” said I: said she, “It is in the semblance
of a vulture<a id="r244"></a><a href="#f244" class="c014"><sup>[244]</sup></a> and upon it is a writing which I cannot read.
So go thou thither and seize it, and set it before thee and, taking
a chafing-dish, throw into it a little musk, whereupon there will
arise a smoke which will draw the Ifrits to thee, and they will all
present themselves before thee, nor shall one be absent; also they
shall be subject to thy word and, whatsoever thou biddest them,
that will they do. Arise therefore and fall to this thing, with the
blessing of Almighty Allah.” I answered, “Hearkening and
obedience” and, going to the column, did as she bade me, whereupon
the Ifrits all presented themselves before me saying, “Here
are we, O our lord! Whatsoever thou biddest us, that will we do.”
Quoth I, “Bind the Marid who brought the damsel hither from
her home.” Quoth they, “We hear and obey,” and off they flew
and bound that Marid in straitest bonds and returned after a
while, saying, “We have done thy bidding.” Then I dismissed
them and, repairing to my wife, told her what had happened
and said to her, “O my bride, wilt thou go with me?” “Yes,”
<span class="pageno" id="Page_178">178</span>answered she. So I carried her forth of the vaulted chamber
whereby I had entered the city and we fared on, till we fell in
with the folk who had shown me the way to find her.——And
Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her
permitted say.</p>

me out a path which shall lead me to my home,” and they did
accordingly, and brought us a-foot to the sea-shore and set us
aboard a vessel which sailed on before us with a fair wind, till we
reached Bassorah-city. And when we entered the house of my
father-in-law and her people saw my wife, they rejoiced with
exceeding joy. Then I fumigated the vulture with musk and lo!
the Ifrits flocked to me from all sides, saying, “At thy service;
what wilt thou have us do?” So I bade them transport all that
was in the City of Brass of monies and noble metals and stones
of price to my house in Bassorah, which they did; and I then
ordered them to bring me the ape. They brought him before
me, abject and contemptible, and I said to him, “O accursed,
why hast thou dealt thus perfidiously with me?” Then I commanded
the Ifrits to shut him in a brazen vessel;<a id="r245"></a><a href="#f245" class="c014"><sup>[245]</sup></a> so they put
him in a brazen cucurbite and sealed it with lead. But I abode
with my wife in joy and delight; and now, O Commander of the
Faithful, I have under my hand precious things in such measure
and rare jewels and other treasure and monies on such wise as
neither reckoning may express nor may limits comprise; and, if
thou lust after wealth or aught else, I will command the Jinn at

Allah. Thereupon the Commander of the Faithful wondered
greatly and bestowed on him imperial gifts, in exchange for his
presents, and entreated him with the favour he deserved. And

  <h2 id="c179" class="c007">GENEROUS DEALING OF YAHYA BIN KHALID THE BARMECIDE WITH MANSUR.</h2>
</div>

<p class="c013">It is told that Harun al-Rashid, in the days before he became
jealous of the Barmecides, sent once for one of his guards, Sálih
by name, and said to him, “O Salih, go to Mansúr<a id="r246"></a><a href="#f246" class="c014"><sup>[246]</sup></a> and say to
him:—Thou owest us a thousand thousand dirhams and we require
of thee immediate payment of this amount. And I command thee,
O Salih, unless he pay it between this hour and sundown, sever his
head from his body and bring it to me.” “To hear is to obey,”
answered Salih and, going to Mansur, acquainted him with what
the Caliph had said; whereupon quoth he, “I am a lost man, by
Allah; for all my estate and all my hand owneth, if sold for their
utmost value, would not fetch a price of more than an hundred
thousand dirhams. Whence then, O Salih, shall I get the other
nine hundred thousand?” Salih replied, “Contrive how thou mayst
speedily acquit thyself, else thou art a dead man; for I cannot
grant thee an eye-twinkling of delay after the time appointed me
by the Caliph; nor can I fail of aught which the Prince of True
Believers hath enjoined on me. Hasten, therefore, to devise some
means of saving thyself ere the time expire.” Quoth Mansur,
“O Salih, I beg thee of thy favour to bring me to my house, that
I may take leave of my children and family and give my kinsfolk
my last injunctions.” Now Salih relateth:—So I went with him
to his house where he fell to bidding his family farewell, and the
house was filled with a clamour of weeping and lamentations and
calling for help on Almighty Allah. Thereupon I said to him, “I
have bethought me that Allah may haply vouchsafe thee relief at
the hands of the Barmecides. Come, let us go to the house of
Yáhyá bin Khálid.” So we went to Yahya’s house, and Mansur
told him his case, whereat he was sore concerned and bowed him
groundwards for a while; then raising his head, he called his
treasurer and said to him, “How much have we in our treasury?”
“A matter of five thousand dirhams,” answered the treasurer, and
Yahya bade him bring them and sent a messenger to his son, Al-Fazl,
saying, “I am offered for sale a splendid estate which may
never be laid waste; so send me somewhat of money.” Al-Fazl
<span class="pageno" id="Page_180">180</span>sent him a thousand thousand dirhams, and he despatched a messenger
with a like message to his son Ja’afar, saying, “We have a
matter of much moment and for it we want money;” whereupon
Ja’afar at once sent him a thousand thousand dirhams; nor did
Yahya leave sending to his kinsmen of the Barmecides, till he had
collected from them a great sum of money for Mansur. But Salih
and the debtor knew not of this; and Mansur said to Yahya, “O
my lord, I have laid hold upon thy skirt, for I know not whither
to look for the money but to thee, in accordance with thy wonted
generosity; so discharge thou the rest of my debt for me and
make me thy freed slave.” Thereupon Yahya hung down his head
and wept; then he said to a page, “Harkye, boy, the Commander
of the Faithful gave our slave-girl Danánír a jewel of great price:
go thou to her and bid her send it to us.” The page went out and
presently returned with the jewel, whereupon quoth Yahya, “O
Mansur, I bought this jewel of the merchant for the Commander
of the Faithful, at a price of two hundred thousand dinars,<a id="r247"></a><a href="#f247" class="c014"><sup>[247]</sup></a> and
he gave it to our slave-girl Dananir, the lute-player; and when he
sees it with thee, he will know it and spare thy blood and do thee
honour for our sake; and now, O Mansur, verily thy money is
complete.” (Salih continued) So I took the money and the jewel
and carried them to Al-Rashid together with Mansur, but on
the way I heard him repeat this couplet, applying it to his own
case:—</p>

<div class="lg-container-b c003">

      <div class="line">‘Twas not of love that fared my feet to them; ✿ ‘Twas that I feared me lest they shoot their shafts!</div>

  </div>
</div>

<p class="c000">Now when I heard this, I marvelled at his evil nature and his
depravity and mischief-making and his ignoble birth and provenance
and, turning upon him, I said, “There is none on the
face of the earth better or more righteous than the Barmecides,
nor any baser nor more wrongous than thou; for they bought
thee off from death and delivered thee from destruction, giving
thee what should save thee; yet thou thankest them not nor
praisest them, neither acquittest thee after the manner of the
noble; nay, thou meetest their benevolence with this speech.”
Then I went to Al-Rashid and acquainted him with all that had
passed——And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased
to say her permitted say.</p>

I acquainted the Commander of the Faithful with all
that passed and Al-Rashid marvelled at the generosity and benevolence
of Yahya and the vileness and ingratitude of Mansur and
bade restore the jewel to Yahya, saying, “Whatso we have given
it befitteth us not to take again.” After that Salih returned to
Yahya, and acquainted him with the tale of Mansur and his ill-conduct;
whereupon replied he, “O Salih, when a man is in want,
sick at heart and sad of thought, he is not to be blamed for aught
that falleth from him; for it cometh not from the heart;” and on
this wise he took to seeking excuse for Mansur. But Salih wept
and exclaimed, “Never shall the revolving heavens bring forth
into being the like of thee, O Yahya! Alas, and well-away, that
one of such noble nature and generosity should be laid in the
dust!” And he repeated these two couplets:—</p>

hatred being that Harun al-Rashid loved Abdullah with exceeding

bewitched the Commander of the Faithful. And thus they abode
a long while, with rancour in their hearts, till it fell out that the

cleverness; but he had lost his money and wasted his wealth and
his estate was come to ill case; so he forged a letter to Abdullah
bin Malik in the name of Yahya bin Khalid and set out therewith
for Armenia. Now when he came to the Governor’s gate, he
gave the letter to one of the Chamberlains, who took it and carried
it to his master. Abdullah opened it and read it and, considering
it attentively, knew it to be forged; so he sent for the
man, who presented himself before him and called down blessings
upon him and praised him and those of his court. Quoth Abdullah
to him, “What moved thee to weary thyself on this wise and bring
me a forged letter? But be of good heart; for we will not disappoint
thy travail.” Replied the other, “Allah prolong the life
of our lord the Wazir! If my coming annoy thee, cast not about
for a pretext to repel me, for Allah’s earth is wide and He who
giveth daily bread still liveth. Indeed, the letter I bring thee from
Yahya bin Khalid is true and no forgery.” Quoth Abdullah, “I
will write a letter to my agent<a id="r250"></a><a href="#f250" class="c014"><sup>[250]</sup></a> at Baghdad and command him
enquire concerning this same letter. If it be true, as thou sayest,
and genuine and not forged by thee, I will bestow on thee the
Emir-ship of one of my cities; or, if thou prefer a present, I will
give thee two hundred thousand dirhams, besides horses and camels
of price and a robe of honour. But, if the letter prove a forgery,
I will order thou be beaten with two hundred blows of a stick
and thy beard be shaven.” So Abdullah bade confine him in a
chamber and furnish him therein with all he needed, till his case
should be made manifest. Then he despatched a letter to his
agent at Baghdad, to the following effect:—“There is come to me
a man with a letter purporting to be from Yahya bin Khalid.
Now I have my suspicions of this letter: therefore delay thou not
in the matter, but go thyself and look carefully into the case and
<span class="pageno" id="Page_183">183</span>let me have an answer with all speed, in order that we may know
what is true and what is untrue.” When the letter reached Baghdad,
the agent mounted at once——And Shahrazad perceived the
dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say.</p>

<div class="nf-center-c1">
<div class="nf-center c005">
    <div>Now when it was the Three Hundred and Seventh Night,</div>
  </div>
</div>

</div>

<p class="c000">She said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that the agent
of Abdullah son of Malik al-Khuza’i, on receipt of the letter at
Baghdad, mounted at once and repaired to the house of Yahya bin
Khalid, whom he found sitting with his officers and boon-companions.
After the usual salute he gave him the letter and Yahya
read it and said to the agent, “Come back to me to-morrow for
my written answer.” Now when the agent had gone away, Yahya
turned to his companions and said, “What doth he deserve who
forgeth a letter in my name and carrieth it to my foe?” They
answered all and each, saying this and that, and every one proposing
some kind of punishment; but Yahya said, “Ye err in that
ye say and this your counsel is of the baseness of your spirits and
the meanness of your minds. Ye all know the close favour of
Abdullah with the Caliph and ye weet of what is between him and
us of anger and enmity; and now Almighty Allah hath made this
man the means of reconciliation between us; and hath fitted him
for such purpose and hath appointed him to quench the fire of ire
in our hearts, which hath been growing these twenty years; and
by his means our differences shall be adjusted. Wherefore it behoveth
me to requite such man by verifying his assertion and
amending his estate; so I will write him a letter to Abdullah
son of Malik, praying that he may use him with increase of honour
and continue to him his liberality.” Now when his companions
heard what he said, they called down blessings on him and marvelled
at his generosity and the greatness of his magnanimity.
Then he called for paper and ink and wrote Abdullah a letter in
his own hand, to the following effect:—“In the name of Allah, the
Compassionating, the Compassionate! Of a truth thy letter hath
reached me (Allah give thee long life!) and I am glad to hear of
thy safety and am pleased to be assured of thine immunity and
prosperity. It was thy thought that a certain worthy man had
forged a letter in my name and that he was not the bearer of any
<span class="pageno" id="Page_184">184</span>message from the same; but the case is not so, for the letter I
myself wrote, and it was no forgery; and I hope, of thy courtesy
and consideration and the nobility of thy nature, that thou wilt
gratify this generous and excellent man of his hope and wish, and
honour him with the honour he deserveth and bring him to his
desire and make him the special object of thy favour and munificence.
Whatso thou dost with him, it is to me that thou dost the
kindness, and I am thankful to thee accordingly.” Then he superscribed
the letter and after sealing it, delivered it to the agent, who
despatched it to Abdullah. Now when the Governor read it, he
was charmed with its contents, and sending for the man, said to
him, “Whichever of the two promised boons is the more acceptable
to thee that will I give thee.” The man replied, “The money
gift were more acceptable to me than aught else,” whereupon
Abdullah ordered him two hundred thousand dirhams and ten
Arab horses, five with housings of silk and other five with richly
ornamented saddles, used in state processions; besides twenty
chests of clothes and ten mounted white slaves and a proportionate
quantity of jewels of price. Moreover, he bestowed on him a
dress of honour and sent him to Baghdad in great splendour. So
when he came thither, he repaired to the door of Yahya’s house,
before he went to his own folk, and craved permission to enter and
have audience. The Chamberlain went in to Yahya and said to
him, “O my lord, there is one at the door who craveth speech of
thee; and he is a man of apparent wealth, courteous in manner,
comely of aspect and attended by many servants.” Then Yahya
bade admit him; and, when he entered and kissed the ground
before him, Yahya asked him, “Who art thou?” He answered,
“Hear me, O my lord, I am he who was done dead by the
tyranny of fortune, but thou didst raise me to life again from the
grave of calamities and exalt me to the paradise of my desires. I
am the man who forged a letter in thy name and carried it to
Abdullah bin Malik al-Khuza’i.” Yahya asked, “How hath he
dealt with thee and what did he give thee?”; and the man
answered, “He hath given me, thanks to thy hand and thy great
liberality and benevolence and to thy comprehensive kindness
and lofty magnanimity and thine all-embracing generosity, that
which hath made me a wealthy man and he hath distinguished
me with his gifts and favours. And now I have brought all
that he gave me and here it is at thy door; for it is thine to
decide and the command is in thy hand.” Rejoined Yahya,
<span class="pageno" id="Page_185">185</span>“Thou hast done me better service than I did thee and I owe
thee a heavy debt of gratitude and every gift the white hand<a id="r251"></a><a href="#f251" class="c014"><sup>[251]</sup></a>
can give, for that thou hast changed into love and amity the hate
and enmity that were between me and a man whom I respect
and esteem. Wherefore I will give thee the like of what Abdullah
bin Malik gave thee.” Then he ordered him money and horses
and chests of apparel, such as Abdullah had given him; and thus
that man’s fortune was restored to him by the munificence of
these two generous ones. And folk also relate the tale of the</p>

  <h2 id="c185" class="c007">CALIPH AL-MAAMUN AND THE STRANGE SCHOLAR</h2>
</div>

<p class="c013">It is said of Al-Maamun that, among the Caliphs of the house of
Abbas, there was none more accomplished in all branches of
knowledge than he. Now on two days in each week, he was
wont to preside at conferences of the learned, when the lawyers
and theologians disputed in his presence, each sitting in his
several rank and room. One day as he sat thus, there came into
the assembly a stranger, clad in ragged white clothes, who took
seat in an obscure place behind the doctors of the law. Then the
assembly began to speak and debate difficult questions, it being
the custom that the various propositions should be submitted to
each in turn, and that whoso bethought him of some subtle
addition or rare conceit, should make mention of it. So the
question went round till it came to the strange man, who spake
in his turn and made a goodlier answer than any of the doctors’
replies; and the Caliph approved his speech.——And Shahrazad
perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say.</p>

<div>

<div class="nf-center-c1">
<div class="nf-center c005">
    <div>Now when it was the Three Hundred and Eighth Night,</div>
  </div>
</div>

</div>

<p class="c000">She said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that the Caliph
Al-Maamun approved his speech and ordered him to come up from
his low place to a high stead. Now when the second question
came to him, he made a still more notable answer, and Al-Maamun
ordered him to be preferred to a yet higher seat; and when the
third question reached him, he made answer more justly and
<span class="pageno" id="Page_186">186</span>appropriately than on the two previous occasions, and Al-Maamun
bade him come up and sit near himself. Presently the discussion
ended when water was brought and they washed their hands;
after which food was set on and they ate; and the doctors arose
and withdrew; but Al-Maamun forbade the stranger to depart
with them and, calling him to himself, treated him with especial
favour and promised him honour and profit. Thereupon they
made ready the séance of wassail; the fair-faced cup-companions
came and the pure wine<a id="r252"></a><a href="#f252" class="c014"><sup>[252]</sup></a> went round amongst them, till the cup
came to the stranger, who rose to his feet and spake thus, “If the
Commander of the Faithful permit me, I will say one word.”
Answered the Caliph, “Say what thou wilt.” Quoth the man,
“Verily the Exalted Intelligence (whose eminence Allah increase!)
knoweth that his slave was this day, in the august
assembly, one of the unknown folk and of the meanest of the
company; and the Commander of the Faithful raised his rank
and brought him near to himself, little as were the wit and
wisdom he displayed, preferring him above the rest and advancing
him to a station and a degree whereto his thought aspired not.
But now he is minded to part him from that small portion of
intellect which raised him high from his lowness and made him
great after his littleness. Heaven forfend and forbid that the
Commander of the Faithful should envy his slave what little he
hath of understanding and worth and renown! Now, if his slave
should drink wine, his reason would depart far from him and
ignorance draw near to him and steal away his good breeding; so
would he revert to that low and contemptible degree, whence he
sprang, and become ridiculous and despicable in the eyes of the
folk. I hope, therefore, that the August Intelligence, of his power
and bounty and royal generosity and magnanimity, will not
despoil his slave of this jewel.” When the Caliph Al-Maamun
heard his speech, he praised him and thanked him and making
him sit down again in his place, showed him high honour and
ordered him a present of an hundred thousand silver pieces.
Moreover he mounted him upon a horse and gave him rich
apparel; and in every assembly he was wont to exalt him and
<span class="pageno" id="Page_187">187</span>show him favour over all the other doctors of law and religion till
he became the highest of them all in rank. And Allah is All-knowing.<a id="r253"></a><a href="#f253" class="c014"><sup>[253]</sup></a>

<p class="c013">There lived once in the days of yore and the good old times long
gone before, in the land of Khorasan, a merchant called Majd al-Dín,
who had great wealth and many slaves and servants, white and
black, young and old; but he had not been blessed with a child
until he reached the age of threescore, when Almighty Allah vouchsafed
him a son, whom he named Alí Shár. The boy grew up like
the moon on the night of fulness; and when he came to man’s
estate and was endowed with all kinds of perfections, his father
fell sick of a death-malady and, calling his son to him, said, “O
my son, the fated hour of my decease is at hand, and I desire to
give thee my last injunctions.” He asked, “And what are they,
O my father?”; and he answered, “O my son, I charge thee, be
not over-familiar with any<a id="r255"></a><a href="#f255" class="c014"><sup>[255]</sup></a> and eschew what leadeth to evil and

<p class="c000">This, then, is my charge to thee; bear it before thine eyes, and
Allah stand to thee in my stead.” Then he swooned away and
kept silent awhile; and, when he came to himself, he besought
pardon of Allah and pronounced the profession of the Faith, and
was admitted to the mercy of the Almighty. So his son wept and
lamented for him and presently made proper preparation for his
burial; great and small walked in his funeral procession and
Koran-readers recited Holy Writ about his bier; nor did Ali
Shar omit aught of what was due to the dead. Then they
prayed over him and committed him to the dust and wrote
these two couplets upon his tomb:—</p>

    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class="c000">Now his son Ali Shar grieved for him with sore grief and mourned
him with the ceremonies usual among men of note; nor did he
cease to weep the loss of his father till his mother died also, not
long afterwards, when he did with her as he had done with his
sire. Then he sat in the shop, selling and buying and consorting
with none of Almighty Allah’s creatures, in accordance with
his father’s injunction. This wise he continued to do for a year,
at the end of which time there came in to him by craft certain
whoreson fellows and consorted with him, till he turned after their
example to lewdness and swerved from the way of righteousness,
drinking wine in flowing bowls and frequenting fair women night
and day; for he said to himself, “Of a truth my father amassed
this wealth for me, and if I spend it not, to whom shall I leave it?
By Allah, I will not do save as saith the poet:—</p>

<p class="c000"><span class="pageno" id="Page_191">191</span>And Ali Shar ceased not to waste his wealth all whiles of the day
and all watches of the night, till he had made away with the whole
of his riches and abode in pauper case and troubled at heart. So
he sold his shop and lands and so forth, and after this he sold the
clothes off his body, leaving himself but one suit; and, as drunkenness
quitted him and thoughtfulness came to him, he fell into grief
and sore care. One day, when he had sat from daybreak to mid-afternoon
without breaking his fast, he said in his mind, “I will go
round to those on whom I spent my monies: perchance one of them
will feed me this day.” So he went the round of them all; but, as
often as he knocked at any one’s door of them, the man denied himself
and hid from him, till his stomach ached with hunger. Then he
betook himself to the bazar of the merchants——And Shahrazad

      <div class="line"><span class="pageno" id="Page_192">192</span>The full moon is her face<a id="r263"></a><a href="#f263" class="c014"><sup>[263]</sup></a> and the branchlet is her shape, ✿ And the musk-pod is her scent—what like her can there be?</div>
      <div class="line">‘Tis as though she were moulded from water of the pearl, ✿ And in every lovely limblet another moon we see!</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class="c000">And her name was Zumurrud—the Smaragdine. So when Ali Shar
saw her, he marvelled at her beauty and grace and said, “By
Allah, I will not stir hence till I see how much this girl fetcheth,
and know who buyeth her!” So he took standing-place amongst
the merchants, and they thought he had a mind to buy her, knowing
the wealth he had inherited from his parents. Then the broker
stood at the damsel’s head and said, “Ho, merchants! Ho, ye
men of money! Who will open the gate of biddings for this
damsel, the mistress of moons, the union pearl, Zumurrud the
curtain-maker, the sought of the seeker and the delight of the
desirous? Open the biddings’ door and on the opener be nor
blame nor reproach for evermore.” Thereupon quoth one merchant,
“Mine for five hundred dinars;” “and ten,” quoth another.
“Six hundred,” cried an old man named Rashíd al-Din, blue
of eye<a id="r264"></a><a href="#f264" class="c014"><sup>[264]</sup></a> and foul of face. “And ten,” cried another. “I bid a
thousand,” rejoined Rashid al-Din; whereupon the rival merchants
were tongue-tied, and held their peace and the broker took counsel
with the girl’s owner, who said, “I have sworn not to sell her save
to whom she shall choose: so consult her.” Thereupon the broker
went up to Zumurrud and said to her, “O mistress of moons, this
merchant hath a mind to buy thee.” She looked at Rashid al-Din
and finding him as we have said, replied, “I will not be sold to a
greybeard, whom decrepitude hath brought to such evil plight.
Allah inspired his saying who saith:—</p>

<div class="lg-container-b c003">
  <div class="linegroup">
    <div class="group">
      <div class="line">I craved of her a kiss one day; but soon as she beheld ✿ My hoary</div>
      <div class="line">hairs, though I my luxuries and wealth display’d;</div>
      <div class="line"><span class="pageno" id="Page_193">193</span>She
 proudly turned away from me, showed shoulders, cried aloud:— ✿ ‘No! no!

      <div class="line">For hoary head and grizzled chin I’ve no especial love: ✿ What! stuff my mouth with cotton<a id="r265"></a><a href="#f265" class="c014"><sup>[265]</sup></a> ere in sepulchre I’m laid?’”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class="c000">Now when the broker heard her words he said, “By Allah, thou
art excusable, and thy price is ten thousand gold pieces!” So
he told her owner that she would not accept of old man Rashid
al-Din, and he said, “Consult her concerning another.” Thereupon
a second man came forward and said, “Be she mine for what
price was offered by the oldster she would have none of;” but she
looked at him and seeing that his beard was dyed, said “What be
this fashion lewd and base and the blackening of the hoary face?”
And she made a great show of wonderment and repeated these
couplets:—</p>

<div class="lg-container-b c003">
  <div class="linegroup">
    <div class="group">
      <div class="line">Showed me Sir Such-an-one a sight and what a frightful sight! ✿ A neck, by Allah, only made for slipper-sole to smite:<a id="r266"></a><a href="#f266" class="c014"><sup>[266]</sup></a></div>
      <div class="line">A beard the meetest racing-ground where gnats and lice contend, ✿ A brow fit only for the ropes thy temples chafe and bite.<a id="r267"></a><a href="#f267" class="c014"><sup>[267]</sup></a></div>
      <div class="line">O thou enravisht by my cheek and beauties of my form, ✿ Why so translate thyself to youth and think I deem it right?</div>
      <div class="line">Dyeing disgracefully that white of reverend aged hairs, ✿ And hiding for foul purposes their venerable white!</div>
      <div class="line">Thou goest with one beard and comest back with quite another, ✿ Like Punch-and-Judy man who works the Chinese shades by night.<a id="r268"></a><a href="#f268" class="c014"><sup>[268]</sup></a></div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class="c000"><span class="pageno" id="Page_194">194</span>And how well saith another:—</p>

<div class="lg-container-b c003">
  <div class="linegroup">
    <div class="group">
      <div class="line">Quoth she, “I see thee dye thy hoariness:”<a id="r269"></a><a href="#f269" class="c014"><sup>[269]</sup></a> ✿ “To hide, O ears and eyes! from thee,” quoth I:</div>
      <div class="line">She roared with laugh and said, “Right funny this; ✿ Thou art so lying e’en thy hair’s a lie!”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class="c000">Now when the broker heard her verse he exclaimed, “By Allah
thou hast spoken sooth!” The merchant asked what she said:
so the broker repeated the verses to him; and he knew that she
was in the right while he was wrong and desisted from buying
her. Then another came forward and said, “Ask her if she will
be mine at the same price;” but, when he did so, she looked at
him and seeing that he had but one eye, said, “This man is
one-eyed; and it is of such as he that the poet saith:<a id="r270"></a><a href="#f270" class="c014"><sup>[270]</sup></a>—</p>

      <div class="line">Had this monocular a jot of good, ✿ Allah had ne’er brought blindness to his eye!”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class="c000">Then said the broker, pointing to another bidder, “Wilt thou
be sold to this man?” She looked at him and seeing that he
was short of stature<a id="r271"></a><a href="#f271" class="c014"><sup>[271]</sup></a> and had a beard that reached to his navel,
cried, “This is he of whom the poet speaketh:—</p>

    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class="c000">Said the broker, “O my lady, look who pleaseth thee of these
<span class="pageno" id="Page_195">195</span>that are present, and point him out, that I may sell thee to him.”
So she looked round the ring of merchants, examining one by
one their physiognomies, till her glance fell on Ali Shar,——And
Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her
permitted say.</p>

<div class="nf-center-c1">
<div class="nf-center c005">
    <div>Now when it was the Three Hundred and Eleventh Night,</div>

</div>

<p class="c000">She said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that when the
girl’s glance fell on Ali Shar, she cast at him a look with longing
eyes, which cost her a thousand sighs, and her heart was taken
with him; for that he was of favour passing fair and pleasanter
than zephyr or northern air; and she said, “O broker, I will be
sold to none but to this my lord, owner of the handsome face and

    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class="c000"><span class="pageno" id="Page_196">196</span>And as saith another:—</p>

<div class="lg-container-b c003">
  <div class="linegroup">
    <div class="group">
      <div class="line">Quoth they, “Black letters on his cheek are writ! ✿ How canst thou love him and a side-beard see?”</div>
      <div class="line">Quoth I, “Cease blame and cut your chiding short; ✿ If those be letters ‘tis a forgery:”</div>
      <div class="line">Gather his charms all growths of Eden-garth ✿ Whereto those Kausar<a id="r276"></a><a href="#f276" class="c014"><sup>[276]</sup></a>-lips bear testimony.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class="c000">When the broker heard the verses she repeated on the charms of
Ali Shar, he marvelled at her eloquence, no less than at the
brightness of her beauty; but her owner said to him, “Marvel
not at her splendour which shameth the noonday sun, nor that
her memory is stored with the choicest verses of the poets; for,
besides this, she can repeat the glorious Koran, according to the
seven readings,<a id="r277"></a><a href="#f277" class="c014"><sup>[277]</sup></a> and the august Traditions, after ascription and
authentic transmission; and she writeth the seven modes of handwriting<a id="r278"></a><a href="#f278" class="c014"><sup>[278]</sup></a>
and she knoweth more learning and knowledge than the
most learned. Moreover, her hands are better than gold and
silver; for she maketh silken curtains and selleth them for fifty
gold pieces each; and it taketh her but eight days to make a
curtain.” Exclaimed the broker, “O happy the man who hath
her in his house and maketh her of his choicest treasures!”; and
her owner said to him, “Sell her to whom she will.” So the
broker went up to Ali Shar and, kissing his hands, said to him,
“O my lord, buy thou this damsel, for she hath made choice of
thee.”<a id="r279"></a><a href="#f279" class="c014"><sup>[279]</sup></a> Then he set forth to him all her charms and accomplishments,
and added, “I give thee joy if thou buy her, for this
be a gift from Him who is no niggard of His giving.” Whereupon
Ali bowed his head groundwards awhile, laughing at himself
and secretly saying, “Up to this hour I have not broken my
fast; yet I am ashamed before the merchants to own that I
have no money wherewith to buy her.” The damsel, seeing him
hang down his head, said to the broker, “Take my hand and
lead me to him, that I may show my beauty to him and tempt
him to buy me; for I will not be sold to any but to him.” So
the broker took her hand and stationed her before Ali Shar,
<span class="pageno" id="Page_197">197</span>saying, “What is thy good pleasure, O my lord?” But he made
him no answer, and the girl said to him, “O my lord and darling
of my heart, what aileth thee that thou wilt not bid for me? Buy
me for what thou wilt and I will bring thee good fortune.” So he
raised his eyes to her and said, “Is buying perforce? Thou art
dear at a thousand dinars.” Said she, “Then buy me, O my lord,
for nine hundred.” He cried, “No,” and she rejoined, “Then
for eight hundred;” and though he again said, “Nay,” she ceased
not to abate the price, till she came to an hundred dinars. Quoth
he, “I have not by me a full hundred.” So she laughed and
asked, “How much dost thou lack of an hundred?” He
answered, “By Allah, I have neither an hundred dinars, nor any
other sum; for I own neither white coin nor red cash, neither
dinar nor dirham. So look out thou for another and a better
customer.” And when she knew that he had nothing, she said to
him, “Take me by the hand and carry me aside into a by-lane, as
if thou wouldst examine me privily.” He did so and she drew
from her bosom a purse containing a thousand dinars, which she
gave him, saying, “Pay down nine hundred to my price and let
the hundred remain with thee by way of provision.” He did as
she bid him and, buying her for nine hundred dinars, paid down
the price from her own purse and carried her to his house. When
she entered it, she found a dreary desolate saloon without carpets
or vessels; so she gave him other thousand dinars, saying, “Go to
the bazar and buy three hundred dinars’ worth of furniture and
vessels for the house and three dinars’ worth of meat and drink.”——And
Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying
her permitted say.</p>

<div>

<div class="nf-center-c1">
<div class="nf-center c005">
    <div>Now when it was the Three Hundred and Twelfth Night,</div>
  </div>
</div>

</div>

<p class="c000">She said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that quoth the
slave-girl, “Bring us meat and drink for three dinars; furthermore
a piece of silk, the size of a curtain, and bring golden and silvern
thread and sewing-silk of seven colours.” Thus he did, and she
furnished the house and they sat down to eat and drink; after
which they went to bed and took their pleasure one of the other.
And they lay the night embraced behind the curtain and were
even as saith the poet:<a id="r280"></a><a href="#f280" class="c014"><sup>[280]</sup></a>—</p>

<div class="lg-container-b c003">
  <div class="linegroup">
    <div class="group">
      <div class="line"><span class="pageno" id="Page_198">198</span>Cleave fast to her thou lovest and let the envious rail amain; For calumny and envy ne’er to favour love were fain.</div>
      <div class="line">Lo, whilst I slept, in dreams I saw thee lying by my side And, from thy lips the sweetest, sure, of limpid springs did drain.</div>
      <div class="line">Yea, true and certain all I saw is, as I will avouch, And ‘spite the envier, thereto I surely will attain.</div>
      <div class="line">There is no goodlier sight, indeed, for eyes to look upon. Than when one couch in its embrace enfoldeth lovers twain.</div>
      <div class="line">Each to the other’s bosom clasped, clad in their
 twinned delight. Whilst hand with hand and arm with arm about their 
necks enchain,</div>
      <div class="line">Lo, when two hearts are straitly knit in passion and desire, But on cold iron smite the folk who chide at them in vain.</div>
      <div class="line">Thou, that for loving censurest the votaries of love, canst thou assain a heart diseased or heal a cankered brain?</div>
      <div class="line">If in thy time thou find but one to love thee and be true, I rede thee cast the world away and with that one remain.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class="c000">So they lay together till the morning and love for the other waxed
firmly fixed in the heart of each. And on rising, Zumurrud took
the curtain and embroidered it with coloured silks and purfled it
with silver and gold thread and she added thereto a border
depicting round about it all manner birds and beasts; nor is there
in the world a feral but she wrought his semblance. This she
worked in eight days, till she had made an end of it, when she
trimmed it and glazed and ironed it and gave it to her lord,
saying, “Carry it to the bazar and sell it to one of the merchants
at fifty dinars; but beware lest thou sell it to a passer-by, as this
would cause a separation between me and thee, for we have foes
who are not unthoughtful of us.” “I hear and I obey,” answered
he and, repairing to the bazar, sold the curtain to a merchant, as
she bade him; after which he bought a piece of silk for another
curtain and gold and silver and silken thread as before and what
they needed of food, and brought all this to her, giving her the
rest of the money. Now every eight days she made a curtain,
which he sold for fifty dinars, and on this wise passed a whole
year. At the end of that time, he went as usual to the bazar with
a curtain, which he gave to the broker; and there came up to him
a Nazarene who bid him sixty dinars for it; but he refused, and
the Christian continued bidding higher and higher, till he came to
an hundred dinars and bribed the broker with ten ducats. So the
man returned to Ali Shar and told him of the proffered price and
urged him to accept the offer and sell the article at the Nazarene’s
valuation, saying, “O my lord, be not afraid of this Christian for
<span class="pageno" id="Page_199">199</span>that he can do thee no hurt.” The merchants also were urgent
with him; so he sold the curtain to the Christian, albeit his heart
misgave him; and, taking the money, set off to return home.
Presently, as he walked, he found the Christian walking behind
him; so he said to him, “O Nazarene,<a id="r281"></a><a href="#f281" class="c014"><sup>[281]</sup></a> why dost thou follow in
my footsteps?” Answered the other “O my lord, I want a
something at the end of the street, Allah never bring thee to
want!”; but Ali Shar had barely reached his place before the
Christian overtook him; so he said to him, “O accursed, what
aileth thee to follow me wherever I go?” Replied the other, “O
my lord, give me a draught of water, for I am athirst; and with
Allah be thy reward!”<a id="r282"></a><a href="#f282" class="c014"><sup>[282]</sup></a> Quoth Ali Shar to himself, “Verily, this
man is an Infidel who payeth tribute and claimeth our protection<a id="r283"></a><a href="#f283" class="c014"><sup>[283]</sup></a>
and he asketh me for a draught of water; by Allah, I will not
baulk him!”——And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and
ceased to say her permitted say.</p>

<div>

<div class="nf-center-c1">
<div class="nf-center c005">
    <div>Now when it was the Three Hundred and Thirteenth Night,</div>
  </div>
</div>

</div>

<p class="c000">She said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that quoth
Ali Shar to himself, “This man is a tributary Unbeliever and he
asked me for a draught of water; by Allah, I will not baulk
him!” So he entered the house and took a gugglet of water;
but the slave-girl Zumurrud saw him and said to him, “O my
love, hast thou sold the curtain?” He replied, “Yes;” and she
asked, “To a merchant or to a passer-by? for my heart presageth
a parting.” And he answered, “To whom but to a merchant?”
<span class="pageno" id="Page_200">200</span>Thereupon she rejoined, “Tell me the truth of the case, that I
may order my affair; and why take the gugglet of water?” And
he, “To give the broker to drink,” upon which she exclaimed,
“There is no Majesty and there is no Might save in Allah, the
Glorious, the Great!”; and she repeated these two couplets:<a id="r284"></a><a href="#f284" class="c014"><sup>[284]</sup></a>—</p>

<div class="lg-container-b c003">
  <div class="linegroup">
    <div class="group">
      <div class="line">O thou who seekest separation, act leisurely, and let not the embrace of the beloved deceive thee!</div>
      <div class="line">Act leisurely; for the nature of fortune is treacherous, and the end of every union is disjunction.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class="c000">Then he took the gugglet and, going out, found the Christian
within the vestibule and said to him, “How comest thou here and
how darest thou, O dog, enter my house without my leave?”
Answered he, “O my lord, there is no difference between the
door and the vestibule, and I never intended to stir hence, save
to go out; and my thanks are due to thee for thy kindness and
favour, thy bounty and generosity.” Then he took the mug and
emptying it, returned it to Ali Shar, who received it and waited for
him to rise up and to go; but he did not move. So Ali said to
him, “Why dost thou not rise and wend thy way?”; and he
answered, “O my lord, be not of those who do a kindness and
then make it a reproach, nor of those of whom saith the poet:<a id="r285"></a><a href="#f285" class="c014"><sup>[285]</sup></a>—</p>

<div class="lg-container-b c003">
  <div class="linegroup">
    <div class="group">
      <div class="line">They’re gone who when thou stoodest at their door ✿ Would for thy wants so generously cater:</div>
      <div class="line">But stand at door of churls who followed them, ✿ They’d make high favour of a draught of water!”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class="c000">And he continued, “O my lord, I have drunk, and now I would
have thee give me to eat of whatever is in the house, though it
be but a bit of bread or a biscuit with an onion.” Replied Ali
Shar, “Begone, without more chaffer and chatter; there is nothing
in the house.” He persisted, “O my lord, if there be nothing in
the house, take these hundred dinars and bring us something
from the market, if but a single scone, that bread and salt may
pass between us.”<a id="r286"></a><a href="#f286" class="c014"><sup>[286]</sup></a> With this, quoth Ali Shar to himself, “This
<span class="pageno" id="Page_201">201</span>Christian is surely mad; I will take his hundred dinars and bring
him somewhat worth a couple of dirhams and laugh at him.”
And the Nazarene added, “O my lord, I want but a small matter
to stay my hunger, were it but a dry scone and an onion; for the
best food is that which doeth away appetite, not rich viands”; and
how well saith the poet:—</p>

<div class="lg-container-b c003">
  <div class="linegroup">
    <div class="group">
      <div class="line">Hunger is sated with a bone-dry scone, ✿ How is it then<a id="r287"></a><a href="#f287" class="c014"><sup>[287]</sup></a> in woes of want I wone?</div>
      <div class="line">Death is all-justest, lacking aught regard ✿ For Caliph-king and beggar woebegone.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class="c000">Then quoth Ali Shar, “Wait here, while I lock the saloon and
fetch thee somewhat from the market;” and quoth the Christian,
“To hear is to obey.” So Ali Shar shut up the saloon and,
locking the door with a padlock, put the key in his pocket: after
which he went to market and bought fried cheese and virgin
honey and bananas<a id="r288"></a><a href="#f288" class="c014"><sup>[288]</sup></a> and bread, with which he returned to the
house. Now when the Christian saw the provision, he said,
“O my lord, this is overmuch; ‘tis enough for half a score of men
and I am alone; but belike thou wilt eat with me.” Replied
Ali, “Eat by thyself, I am full;” and the Christian rejoined, “O
my lord, the wise say, Whoso eateth not with his guest is a son
of a whore.” Now when Ali Shar heard these words from the
Nazarene, he sat down and ate a little with him, after which he
would have held his hand;——And Shahrazad perceived the
dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say.</p>

<div>

<div class="nf-center-c1">
<div class="nf-center c005">
    <div>Now when it was the Three Hundred and Fourteenth Night,</div>
  </div>
</div>

</div>

<p class="c000">She said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that Ali Shar
sat down and ate a little with him, after which he would have
held his hand; but the Nazarene privily took a banana and
peeled it; then, splitting it in twain, put into one half concentrated
Bhang, mixed with opium, a drachm whereof would overthrow
an elephant; and he dipped it in the honey and gave it
to Ali Shar, saying, “O my lord, by the truth of thy religion, I
<span class="pageno" id="Page_202">202</span>adjure thee to take this.” So Ali Shar, being ashamed to make
him forsworn, took it and swallowed it; but hardly had it settled
well in his stomach, when his head forwent both his feet and
he was as though he had been a year asleep. As soon as the
Nazarene saw this, he rose to his feet as he had been a scald wolf
or a cat-o’-mount<a id="r289"></a><a href="#f289" class="c014"><sup>[289]</sup></a> at bay and, taking the saloon key, left Ali
Shar prostrate and ran off to rejoin his brother. And the cause
of his so doing was that the Nazarene’s brother was the same
decrepit old man who purposed to buy Zumurrud for a thousand
dinars, but she would none of him and jeered him in verse. He
was an Unbeliever inwardly, though a Moslem outwardly, and
had called himself Rashid al-Din;<a id="r290"></a><a href="#f290" class="c014"><sup>[290]</sup></a> and when Zumurrud mocked
him and would not accept of him, he complained to his brother,
the aforesaid Christian who played this sleight to take her from
her master Ali Shar; whereupon his brother, Barsúm by name,
said to him, “Fret not thyself about the business; for I will make
shift to seize her for thee, without expending either dinar or
dirham.” Now he was a skilful wizard, crafty and wicked; so he
watched his time and ceased not his practices till he played Ali
Shar the trick before related; then, taking the key, he went to
his brother and acquainted him with what had passed. Thereupon
Rashid al-Din mounted his she-mule and repaired with his
brother and his servants to the house of Ali Shar, taking with
him a purse of a thousand dinars, wherewith to bribe the Chief
of Police, should he meet him. He opened the saloon-door,
and the men who were with him rushed in upon Zumurrud and
forcibly seized her, threatening her with death, if she spoke; but
they left the place as it was and took nothing therefrom. Lastly,
they left Ali Shar lying in the vestibule after they had shut the
door on him and laid the saloon key by his side. Then the
Christian carried the girl to his own house and setting her
amongst his handmaids and concubines, said to her, “O strumpet,
<span class="pageno" id="Page_203">203</span>I am the old man whom thou didst reject and lampoon; but now
I have thee, without paying dinar or dirham.” Replied she (and
her eyes streamed with tears), “Allah requite thee, O wicked old
man, for sundering me and my lord!” He rejoined, “Wanton
minx and whore that thou art, thou shalt see how I will punish
thee! By the truth of the Messiah and the Virgin, except thou
obey me and embrace my faith, I will torture thee with all manner
of torture!” She replied, “By Allah, though thou cut my flesh
to bits I will not forswear the faith of Al-Islam! It may be
Almighty Allah will bring me speedy relief, for He doth even as
He is lief, and the wise say:—Better body to scathe than a flaw in
faith.” Thereupon the old man called his eunuchs and women,
saying, “Throw her down!” So they threw her down and he
ceased not to beat her with grievous beating, whilst she cried for
help and no help came; then she no longer implored aid but fell
to saying, “Allah is my sufficiency, and He is indeed all-sufficient!”
till her groans ceased and her breath failed her and she
fell into a fainting-fit. Now when his heart was soothed by bashing
her, he said to the eunuchs, “Drag her forth by the feet and cast
her down in the kitchen, and give her nothing to eat.” And after
quietly sleeping that night, on the morrow the accursed old man
sent for her and beat her again, after which he bade the Castrato
return her to her place. When the burning of the blows had
cooled, she said, “There is no God but <em>the</em> God and Mohammed
is the Apostle of God! Allah is my sufficiency and excellent is
my Guardian!” And she called for succour upon our Lord
Mohammed (whom Allah bless and keep!)——And Shahrazad
perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say.</p>

<div>

<div class="nf-center-c1">
<div class="nf-center c005">
    <div>Now when it was the Three Hundred and Fifteenth Night,</div>
  </div>
</div>

</div>

<p class="c000">She said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that Zumurrud
called for succour upon our Lord Mohammed (whom Allah bless
and keep!). Such was her case; but as regards Ali Shar, he ceased
not sleeping till next day, when the Bhang quitted his brain and
he opened his eyes, and cried out, “O Zumurrud”; but no one
answered him. So he entered the saloon and found the empty air
and the fane afar;<a id="r291"></a><a href="#f291" class="c014"><sup>[291]</sup></a> whereby he knew that it was the Nazarene
<span class="pageno" id="Page_204">204</span>who had played him this trick. And he groaned and wept and
lamented and again shed tears, repeating these couplets:—</p>

<div class="lg-container-b c003">
  <div class="linegroup">
    <div class="group">
      <div class="line">O Love thou’rt instant in thy cruellest guise; ✿ Here is my heart ‘twixt fears and miseries:</div>
      <div class="line">Pity, O lords, a thrall who, felled on way ✿ Of Love, erst wealthy now a beggar lies:</div>
      <div class="line">What profits archer’s art if, when the foe ✿ Draw near, his bowstring snap ere arrow flies:</div>
      <div class="line">And when griefs multiply on generous man ✿ And urge, what fort can fend from destinies?</div>
      <div class="line">How much and much I warded parting, but ✿ ‘When Destiny descends she blinds our eyes?’</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class="c000">And when he had ended his verse, he sobbed with loud sobs and
repeated also these couplets:—</p>

<div class="lg-container-b c003">
  <div class="linegroup">
    <div class="group">
      <div class="line">Enrobes with honour sands of camp her foot-step 
wandering lone; ✿ Pines the poor mourner as she wins the stead where 
wont to wone:</div>
      <div class="line">She turns to resting-place of tribe, and yearns thereon to view ✿ The spring-camp lying desolate with ruins overstrown:</div>
      <div class="line">She stands and questions of the site, but with 
the tongue of case ✿ The mount replies, ‘There is no path that leads to 
union, none!</div>
      <div class="line">‘Tis as the lightning flash erewhile bright glittered o’er the camp ✿ And died in darkling air no more to be for ever shown.’</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class="c000">And he repented when repentance availed him naught, and wept
and rent his raiment. Then he hent in hand two stones and went
round about the city, beating his breast with the stones and crying,
“O Zumurrud!” whilst the small boys flocked round him, calling
out, “A madman! A madman!” and all who knew him wept for
him, saying, “This is such an one: what evil hath befallen him?”
Thus he continued doing all that day and, when night darkened
on him, he lay down in one of the city-lanes and slept till morning.
On the morrow, he went round about town with the stones till
eventide, when he returned to his saloon to pass therein the night.
Presently, one of his neighbours saw him, and this worthy old
woman said to him, “O my son, Heaven give thee healing! How
long hast thou been mad?” And he answered her with these two
couplets:<a id="r292"></a><a href="#f292" class="c014"><sup>[292]</sup></a>—</p>

<div class="lg-container-b c003">
  <div class="linegroup">
    <div class="group">
      <div class="line"><span class="pageno" id="Page_205">205</span>They said, Thou ravest upon the person thou lovest. And I replied, The sweets of life are only for the mad.</div>
      <div class="line">Drop the subject of my madness, and bring her upon whom I rave. If she cure my madness do not blame me.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class="c000">So his old neighbour knew him for a lover who had lost his beloved
and said, “There is no Majesty and there is no Might, save
in Allah, the Glorious, the Great! O my son, I wish thou wouldest
acquaint me with the tale of thine affliction. Peradventure Allah
may enable me to help thee against it, if it so please Him.” So he
told her all that had befallen him with Barsum the Nazarene and
his brother the wizard who had named himself Rashid al-Din and,
when she understood the whole case, she said, “O my son, indeed
thou hast excuse.” And her eyes railed tears and she repeated
these two couplets:—</p>

<div class="lg-container-b c003">
  <div class="linegroup">
    <div class="group">
      <div class="line">Enough for lovers in this world their ban and bane: ✿ By Allah, lover ne’er in fire of Sakar fries:</div>
      <div class="line">For, sure, they died of love-desire they never told ✿ Chastely, and to this truth tradition testifies.<a id="r293"></a><a href="#f293" class="c014"><sup>[293]</sup></a></div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class="c000">And after she had finished her verse, she said, “O my son, rise at
once and buy me a crate, such as the jewel-pedlars carry; buy also
bangles and seal-rings and bracelets and ear-rings and other gew-gaws
wherein women delight and grudge not the cash. Put all the
stock into the crate and bring it to me and I will set it on my head
and go round about, in the guise of a huckstress and make search
for her in all the houses, till I happen on news of her—Inshallah!”
So Ali Shar rejoiced in her words and kissed her hands, then, going
out, speedily brought her all she required; whereupon she rose and
donned a patched gown and threw over her head a honey-yellow
veil, and took staff in hand and, with the basket on her head,
began wandering about the passages and the houses. She ceased
not to go from house to house and street to street and quarter to
quarter, till Allah Almighty led her to the house of the accursed
Rashid al-Din the Nazarene where, hearing groans within, she
knocked at the door,——And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of
day and ceased to say her permitted say.</p>

<div><span class="pageno" id="Page_206">206</span></div>
<div>

<div class="nf-center-c1">
<div class="nf-center c005">
    <div>Now when it was the Three Hundred and Sixteenth Night,</div>
  </div>
</div>

</div>

<p class="c000">She said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that when the
old woman heard groans within the house, she knocked at the
door, whereupon a slave-girl came down and opening to her,
saluted her. Quoth the old woman, “I have these trifles for
sale: is there any one with you who will buy aught of them?”
“Yes,” answered the damsel and, carrying her indoors, made her
sit down; whereupon all the slave-girls came round her and each
bought something of her. And as the old woman spoke them
fair and was easy with them as to price, all rejoiced in her, because
of her kind ways and pleasant speech. Meanwhile, she looked
narrowly at the ins and outs of the place to see who it was she
had heard groaning, till her glance fell on Zumurrud, when she
knew her and she began to show her customers yet more kindness.
At last she made sure that Zumurrud was laid prostrate;
so she wept and said to the girls, “O my children, how cometh
yonder young lady in this plight?” Then the slave-girls told her
all what had passed, adding, “Indeed this matter is not of our
choice; but our master commanded us to do thus, and he is now
on a journey?” She said, “O my children, I have a favour to
ask of you, and it is that you loose this unhappy damsel of her
bonds, till you know of your lord’s return, when do ye bind her
again as she was; and you shall earn a reward from the Lord of
all creatures.” “We hear and obey,” answered they and at once
loosing Zumurrud, gave her to eat and drink. Thereupon quoth
the old woman, “Would my leg had been broken, ere I entered
your house!” And she went up to Zumurrud and said to her, “O
my daughter, Heaven keep thee safe; soon shall Allah bring thee
relief.” Then she privily told her that she came from her lord,
Ali Shar, and agreed with her to be on the watch for sounds that
night, saying, “Thy lord will come and stand by the pavilion-bench
and whistle<a id="r294"></a><a href="#f294" class="c014"><sup>[294]</sup></a> to thee; and when thou hearest him, do thou
<span class="pageno" id="Page_207">207</span>whistle back to him and let thyself down to him by a rope from
the window, and he will take thee and go away with thee.” So
Zumurrud thanked the old woman, who went forth and returned
to Ali Shar and told him what she had done, saying, “Go this
night, at midnight, to such a quarter, for the accursed carle’s house
is there and its fashion is thus and thus. Stand under the window
of the upper chamber and whistle; whereupon she will let herself
down to thee; then do thou take her and carry her whither thou
wilt.” He thanked her for her good offices and with flowing tears
repeated these couplets:—</p>

<div class="lg-container-b c003">
  <div class="linegroup">
    <div class="group">
      <div class="line">Now with their says and saids<a id="r295"></a><a href="#f295" class="c014"><sup>[295]</sup></a> no more vex me the chiding race; ✿ My heart is weary and I’m worn to bone by their disgrace:</div>

      <div class="line">As for forgetting you or love ‘tis thing I never knew; ✿ Nor in my thought shall ever pass a living thing but you.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class="c000">And when he ended his verses, he sighed and shed tears and
repeated also these couplets:—</p>

<div class="lg-container-b c003">
  <div class="linegroup">
    <div class="group">
      <div class="line">Divinely were inspired his words who brought me news of you; ✿ For brought he unto me a gift was music in mine ear:</div>

    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class="c000">He waited till night darkened and, when came the appointed time,
he went to the quarter she had described to him and saw and
recognised the Christian’s house; so he sat down on the bench
under the gallery. Presently drowsiness overcame him and he
slept (Glory be to Him who sleepeth not!), for it was long since
he had tasted sleep, by reason of the violence of his passion,
<span class="pageno" id="Page_208">208</span>and he became as one drunken with slumber. And while he was
on this wise——And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and
ceased saying her permitted say.</p>

<div>

<div class="nf-center-c1">
<div class="nf-center c005">
    <div>Now when it was the Three Hundred and Seventeenth Night,</div>
  </div>
</div>

</div>

<p class="c000">She said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that while he lay
asleep, behold, a certain thief, who had come out that night and
prowled about the skirts of the city to steal somewhat, happened
by the decree of Destiny, on the Nazarene’s house. He went
round about it, but found no way of climbing up into it, and
presently on his circuit he came to the bench, where he saw Ali
Shar asleep and stole his turband; and, as he was taking it,
suddenly Zumurrud looked out and seeing the thief standing in
the darkness, took him for her lord; whereupon she let herself
down to him by the rope with a pair of saddle-bags full of gold.
Now when the robber saw that, he said to himself, “This is a
wondrous thing, and there must needs be some marvellous cause
to it.” Then he snatched up the saddle-bags, and threw Zumurrud
over his shoulders and made off with both like the blinding lightning.
Quoth she, “Verily, the old woman told me that thou wast
weak with illness on my account; and here thou art, stronger than
a horse.” He made her no reply; so she put her hand to his
face and felt a beard like the broom of palm-frond used for the
Hammam,<a id="r297"></a><a href="#f297" class="c014"><sup>[297]</sup></a> as if he were a hog which had swallowed feathers and
they had come out of his gullet; whereat she took fright and said
to him, “What art thou?” “O strumpet,” answered he, “I am
the sharper Jawán<a id="r298"></a><a href="#f298" class="c014"><sup>[298]</sup></a> the Kurd, of the band of Ahmad al-Danaf;
we are forty sharpers, who will all piss our tallow into thy womb
this night, from dusk to dawn.” When she heard his words, she
wept and beat her face, knowing that Fate had gotten the better
of her and that she had no resource but resignation and to put her
trust in Allah Almighty. So she took patience and submitted
herself to the ordinance of the Lord, saying, “There is no god but
<em>the</em> God! As often as we escape from one woe, we fall into a
<span class="pageno" id="Page_209">209</span>worse.” Now the cause of Jawan’s coming thither was this: he
had said to Calamity-Ahmad, “O Sharper-captain,<a id="r299"></a><a href="#f299" class="c014"><sup>[299]</sup></a> I have been in
this city before and know a cavern without the walls which will
hold forty souls; so I will go before you thither and set my mother
therein. Then will I return to the city and steal somewhat for the
luck of all of you and keep it till you come; so shall you be my
guests and I will show you hospitality this day.” Replied Ahmad
al-Danaf, “Do what thou wilt.” So Jawan went forth to the place
before them and set his mother in the cave; but, as he came out
he found a trooper lying asleep, with his horse picketed beside
him; so he cut his throat and, taking his clothes and his charger
and his arms, hid them with his mother in the cave, where also
he tethered the horse. Then he betook himself to the city and
prowled about, till he happened on the Christian’s house and did
with Ali Shar’s turband and Zumurrud and her saddle-bags as we
have said. He ceased not to run, with Zumurrud on his back, till
he came to the cavern, where he gave her in charge of his mother,
saying, “Keep thou watch over her till I return to thee at first
dawn of day,” and went his ways.——And Shahrazad perceived
the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say.</p>

<div>

<div class="nf-center-c1">
<div class="nf-center c005">
    <div>Now when it was the Three Hundred and Eighteenth Night,</div>
  </div>
</div>

</div>

<p class="c000">She said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that quoth
Kurdish Jawan to his mother, “Keep thou watch over her till I
come back to thee at first dawn of day,” and went his ways. Now
Zumurrud said to herself, “Why am I so heedless about saving my
life and wherefore await till these forty men come?: they will take
their turns to board me, till they make me like a water-logged ship at
sea.” Then she turned to the old woman, Jawan’s mother, and said
to her, “O my aunt, wilt thou not rise up and come without the
cave, that I may louse thee in the sun?”<a id="r300"></a><a href="#f300" class="c014"><sup>[300]</sup></a> Replied the old woman,
“Ay, by Allah, O my daughter: this long time have I been out of
reach of the bath; for these hogs cease not to carry me from place
to place.” So they went without the cavern, and Zumurrud combed
out her head hair and killed the lice on her locks, till the tickling
<span class="pageno" id="Page_210">210</span>soothed her and she fell asleep; whereupon Zumurrud arose and,
donning the clothes of the murthered trooper, girt her waist with
his sword and covered her head with his turband, so that she became
as she were a man. Then, mounting the horse, after she had
taken the saddle bags full of gold she breathed a prayer, “O good
Protector, protect me I adjure thee by the glory of Mohammed
(whom Allah bless and preserve!),” adding these words in thought,
“If I return to the city belike one of the trooper’s folk will see
me, and no good will befal me.” So she turned her back on the
town and rode forth into the wild and the waste. And she ceased
not faring forth with her saddle-bags and the steed, eating of the
growth of the earth and drinking of its waters, she and her horse,
for ten days and, on the eleventh, she came in sight of a city
pleasant and secure from dread, and stablished in happy stead.
Winter had gone from it with his cold showers, and Prime had come
to it with his roses and orange-blossoms and varied flowers; and
its blooms were brightly blowing; its streams were merrily flowing
and its birds warbled coming and going. And she drew near the
dwellings and would have entered the gate when she saw the
troops and Emirs and Grandees of the place drawn up, whereat
she marvelled seeing them in such unusual case and said to herself,
“The people of the city are all gathered at its gate: needs
must there be a reason for this.” Then she made towards them;
but, as she drew near, the soldiery dashed forward to meet her
and, dismounting all, kissed the ground between her hands and
said, “Aid thee Allah, O our lord the Sultan!” Then the notables
and dignitaries ranged themselves before her in double line, whilst
the troops ordered the people in, saying, “Allah aid thee and make
thy coming a blessing to the Moslems, O Sultan of all creatures!
Allah establish thee, O King of the time and union-pearl of the
day and the tide!” Asked Zumurrud, “What aileth you, O
people of this city?” And the Head Chamberlain answered,
“Verily, He hath given to thee who is no niggard in His giving;
and He hath been bountiful to thee and hath made thee Sultan of
this city and ruler over the necks of all who are therein; for know
thou it is the custom of the citizens, when their King deceaseth
leaving no son, that the troops should sally forth to the suburbs
and sojourn there three days: and whoever cometh from the quarter
whence thou hast come, him they make King over them. So
praised be Allah who hath sent us of the sons of the Turks a well-favoured
man; for had a lesser than thou presented himself, he
<span class="pageno" id="Page_211">211</span>had been Sultan.” Now Zumurrud was clever and well-advised in
all she did: so she said, “Think not that I am of the common folk
of the Turks! nay, I am of the sons of the great, a man of condition;
but I was wroth with my family, so I went forth and left
them. See these saddle-bags full of gold which I have brought under
me that, by the way, I might give alms thereof to the poor and
the needy.” So they called down blessings upon her and rejoiced
in her with exceeding joy and she also joyed in them and said in
herself, “Now that I have attained to this”——And Shahrazad
perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say.</p>

<div>

<div class="nf-center-c1">
<div class="nf-center c005">
    <div>Now when it was the Three Hundred and Nineteenth Night,</div>
  </div>
</div>

</div>

<p class="c000">She said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that quoth
Zumurrud to herself, “Now that I have attained to this case,
haply Allah will reunite me with my lord in this place, for He can
do whatso He willeth.” Then the troops escorted her to the city
and, all dismounting, walked before her to the palace. Here she
alighted and the Emirs and Grandees, taking her under both
armpits,<a id="r301"></a><a href="#f301" class="c014"><sup>[301]</sup></a> carried her into the palace and seated her on the
throne; after which they all kissed ground before her. And when
duly enthroned she bade them open the treasuries and gave
largesse to all the troops, who offered up prayers for the continuance
of her reign, and all the townsfolk accepted her rule and
all the lieges of the realm. Thus she abode awhile bidding and
forbidding, and all the people came to hold her in exceeding
reverence and heartily to love her, by reason of her continence
and generosity; for taxes she remitted and prisoners she released
and grievances she redressed; but, as often as she bethought her
of her lord, she wept and besought Allah to reunite her and him;
and one night, as she chanced to be thinking of him and calling to
mind the days she had passed with him, her eyes ran over with
tears and she versified in these two couplets:—</p>

<div class="lg-container-b c003">
  <div class="linegroup">
    <div class="group">
      <div class="line">My yearning for thee though long is fresh, ✿ And the tears which chafe</div>
      <div class="line">these eyelids increase:</div>
      <div class="line">When I weep, I weep from the burn of love, ✿ For to lover severance is</div>
      <div class="line">decease.<a id="r302"></a><a href="#f302" class="c014"><sup>[302]</sup></a></div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class="c000"><span class="pageno" id="Page_212">212</span>And when she had ended her verse, she wiped away her tears and
repairing to the palace, betook herself to the Harim, where she
appointed to the slave-girls and concubines separate lodgings and
assigned them pensions and allowances, giving out that she was
minded to live apart and devote herself to works of piety. So she
applied herself to fasting and praying, till the Emirs said, “Verily,
this Sultan is eminently devout;” nor would she suffer any male
attendants about her, save two little eunuchs to serve her. And
on this wise she held the throne a whole year, during which time
she heard no news of her lord, and failed to hit upon his traces,
which was exceeding grievous to her; so, when her distress
became excessive, she summoned her Wazirs and Chamberlains
and bid them fetch architects and builders and make her in front
of the palace a horse-course, one parasang long and the like broad.
They hastened to do her bidding, and lay out the place to her
liking; and, when it was completed, she went down into it and
they pitched her there a great pavilion, wherein the chairs of the
Emirs were ranged in due order. Moreover, she bade them
spread on the racing-plain tables with all manners of rich meats
and when this was done she ordered the Grandees to eat. So
they ate and she said to them, “It is my will that, on seeing the
new moon of each month, ye do on this wise and proclaim in the
city that no man shall open his shop, but that all our lieges shall
come and eat of the King’s banquet, and that whoso disobeyeth
shall be hanged over his own door.”<a id="r303"></a><a href="#f303" class="c014"><sup>[303]</sup></a> So they did as she bade
them, and ceased not so to do till the first new moon of the second
year appeared; when Zumurrud went down into the horse-course
and the crier proclaimed aloud, saying, “Ho, ye lieges and people
one and all, whoso openeth store or shop or house shall straightway
be hanged over his own door; for it behoveth you to come in
a body and eat of the King’s banquet.” And when the proclamation
became known, they laid the tables and the subjects came in
hosts; so she bade them sit down at the trays and eat their fill
of all the dishes. Accordingly they sat down and she took place
on her chair of state, watching them, whilst each who was at meat
said to himself, “Verily the King looketh at none save me.” Then
<span class="pageno" id="Page_213">213</span>they fell to eating and the Emirs said to them, “Eat and be not
ashamed; for this pleaseth the King.” So they ate their fill and
went away, blessing the Sovereign and saying, one to the other,
“Never in our days saw we a Sultan who loved the poor as doth
this Sultan.” And they wished him length of life. Upon this
Zumurrud returned to her palace,——And Shahrazad perceived
the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say.</p>

    <div>Now when it was the Three Hundred and Twentieth Night,</div>
  </div>
</div>

</div>

<p class="c000">She said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that Queen
Zumurrud returned to her palace, rejoicing in her device and
saying to herself, “Inshallah, I shall surely by this means happen
on news of my lord Ali Shar.” When the first day of the
second month came round, she did as before and when they had
spread the tables she came down from her palace and took place
on her throne and commanded the lieges to sit down and fall to.
Now as she sat on her throne, at the head of the tables, watching
the people take their places company by company and one by one,
behold her eye fell on Barsum, the Nazarene who had bought the
curtain of her lord; and she knew him and said in her mind,
“This is the first of my joy and the winning of my wish.” Then
Barsum came up to the table and, sitting down with the rest to
eat, espied a dish of sweet rice, sprinkled with sugar; but it was
far from him, so he pushed up to it through the crowd and, putting
out his hand to it, seized it and set it before himself. His next
neighbour said to him, “Why dost thou not eat of what is before
thee? Is not this a disgrace to thee? How canst thou reach over
for a dish which is distant from thee? Art thou not ashamed?”
Quoth Barsum, “I will eat of none save this same.” Rejoined the
other, “Eat then, and Allah give thee no good of it!” But
another man, a Hashish-eater, said, “Let him eat of it, that I may
eat with him.” Replied his neighbour, “O unluckiest of Hashish-eaters,
this is no meat for thee; it is eating for Emirs. Let it be,
that it may return to those for whom it is meant and they eat it.”
But Barsum heeded him not and took a mouthful of the rice and
put it in his mouth; and was about to take a second mouthful
when the Queen, who was watching him, cried out to certain of
<span class="pageno" id="Page_214">214</span>her guards, saying, “Bring me yonder man with the dish of sweet
rice before him and let him not eat the mouthful he hath ready
but throw it from his hand.”<a id="r304"></a><a href="#f304" class="c014"><sup>[304]</sup></a> So four of the guards went up to
Barsum and haled him along on his face, after throwing the
mouthful of rice from his hand, and set him standing before
Zumurrud, whilst all the people left eating and said to one
another, “By Allah, he did wrong in not eating of the food
meant for the likes of him.” Quoth one, “For me I was content
with this porridge<a id="r305"></a><a href="#f305" class="c014"><sup>[305]</sup></a> which is before me.” And the Hashish-eater
said, “Praised be Allah who hindered me from eating of
the dish of sugared rice for I expected it to stand before him
and was waiting only for him to have his enjoyment of it, to eat
with him, when there befel him what we see.” And the general
said, one to other, “Wait till we see what shall befal him.” Now
as they brought him before Queen Zumurrud she cried, “Woe to
thee, O blue eyes! What is thy name and why comest thou to
our country?” But the accursed called himself out of his name,
having a white turband<a id="r306"></a><a href="#f306" class="c014"><sup>[306]</sup></a> on, and answered, “O King, my name is
Ali; I work as a weaver and I came hither to trade.” Quoth
Zumurrud, “Bring me a table of sand and a pen of brass,” and
when they brought her what she sought, she took the sand and
the pen, and struck a geomantic figure in the likeness of a baboon;
then, raising her head, she looked hard at Barsum for an hour or
so and said to him, “O dog, how darest thou lie to Kings? Art
thou not a Nazarene, Barsum by name, and comest thou not
hither in quest of somewhat? Speak the truth, or by the glory
of the Godhead, I will strike off thy head!” At this Barsum was
confounded and the Emirs and bystanders said, “Verily, this King
understandeth geomancy: blessed be He who hath gifted him!”
Then she cried out upon the Christian and said, “Tell me the
truth, or I will make an end of thee!” Barsum replied, “Pardon,
O King of the age; thou art right as regards the table, for the
<span class="pageno" id="Page_215">215</span>far one<a id="r307"></a><a href="#f307" class="c014"><sup>[307]</sup></a> is indeed a Nazarene”——And Shahrazad perceived the
dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say.</p>

<div class="nf-center-c1">
<div class="nf-center c005">
    <div>Now when it was the Three Hundred and Twenty-first Night,</div>
  </div>
</div>

</div>

<p class="c000">She said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that Barsum
replied, “Pardon, O King of the age; thou art right as regards
the table, for thy slave is indeed a Nazarene.” Whereupon all
present, gentle and simple, wondered at the King’s skill in hitting
upon the truth by geomancy, and said, “Verily this King is a
diviner, whose like there is not in the world.” Thereupon Queen
Zumurrud bade flay the Nazarene and stuff his skin with straw
and hang it over the gate of the race-course. Moreover, she commanded
to dig a pit without the city and burn therein his flesh
and bones and throw over his ashes offal and ordure. “We hear
and obey,” answered they, and did with him all she bade; and,
when the folk saw what had befallen the Christian, they said,
“Serve him right; but what an unlucky mouthful was that for
him!” And another said, “Be the far one’s wife divorced if this
vow be broken: never again to the end of my days will I eat of
sugared rice!”; and the Hashish-eater cried “Praised be Allah,
who spared me this fellow’s fate by saving me from eating of that
same rice!” Then they all went out, holding it thenceforth unlawful
to sit over against the dish of sweet rice as the Nazarene
had sat. Now when the first day of the third month came, they
laid the tables according to custom, and covered them with dishes
and chargers, and Queen Zumurrud came down and sat on her
throne, with her guards in attendance, as of wont, in awe of her
dignity and majesty. Then the townsfolk entered as before and
went round about the tables, looking for the place of the dish of
sweet rice, and quoth one to another, “Hark ye, O Hájí<a id="r308"></a><a href="#f308" class="c014"><sup>[308]</sup></a> Khalaf!”;
and the other answered, “At thy service, O Hájí Khálid.” Said
Khálid, “Avoid the dish of sweet rice and look thou eat not
thereof; for, if thou do, by early morning thou will be hanged.”<a id="r309"></a><a href="#f309" class="c014"><sup>[309]</sup></a>
<span class="pageno" id="Page_216">216</span>Then they sat down to meat around the table; and, as they were
eating, Queen Zumurrud chanced to look from her throne and saw
a man come running in through the gate of the horse-course; and
having considered him attentively, she knew him for Jawan the
Kurdish thief who murdered the trooper. Now the cause of his coming
was this: when he left his mother, he went to his comrades and
said to them, “I did good business yesterday; for I slew a trooper
and took his horse. Moreover there fell to me last night a pair of
saddle-bags, full of gold, and a young lady worth more than the
money in pouch; and I have left all that with my mother in the
cave.” At this they rejoiced and repaired to the cavern at nightfall,
whilst Jawan the Kurd walked in front and the rest behind;
he wishing to bring them the booty of which he had boasted. But
he found the place clean empty and questioned his mother, who
told him all that had befallen her; whereupon he bit his hands for
regret and exclaimed, “By Allah, I will assuredly make search
for the harlot and take her, wherever she is, though it be in the
shell of a pistachio-nut,<a id="r310"></a><a href="#f310" class="c014"><sup>[310]</sup></a> and quench my malice on her!” So he
went forth in quest of her and ceased not journeying from place
to place, till he came to Queen Zumurrud’s city. On entering he
found the town deserted and, enquiring of some women whom he
saw looking from the windows, they told him that it was the
Sultan’s custom to make a banquet for the people on the first of
each month and that all the lieges were bound to go and eat of it.
Furthermore the women directed him to the racing-ground, where
the feast was spread. So he entered at a shuffling trot; and,
finding no place empty, save that before the dish of sweet rice
already noticed, took his seat right opposite it and stretched out
his hand towards the dish; whereupon the folk cried out to him,
saying, “O our brother, what wouldst thou do?” Quoth he, “I
would eat my fill of this dish.” Rejoined one of the people, “If
thou eat of it thou wilt assuredly find thyself hanged to-morrow
morning.” But Jawan said, “Hold thy tongue and talk not so
unpleasantly.” Then he stretched out his hand to the dish and
drew it to him; but it so chanced that the Hashish-eater of whom
we have spoken, was sitting by him; and when he saw him take
the dish, the fumes of the Hashish left his head and he fled from
his place and sat down afar off, saying, “I will have nothing to do
with yonder dish.” Then Jawan the Kurd put out his hand (which
<span class="pageno" id="Page_217">217</span>was very like a raven’s claws),<a id="r311"></a><a href="#f311" class="c014"><sup>[311]</sup></a> scooped up therewith half the dishful
and drew out his neave as it were a camel’s hoof——And
Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted
say.</p>

<div>

<div class="nf-center-c1">
<div class="nf-center c005">
    <div>Now when it was the Three Hundred and Twenty-second Night,</div>
  </div>
</div>

</div>

<p class="c000">She said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that Jawan the
Kurd drew his neave from the dish as it were a camel’s hoof and
rolled the lump of rice in the palm of his hand, till it was like a
big orange, and threw it ravenously into his mouth; and it rolled
down his gullet, with a rumble like thunder and the bottom of the
deep dish appeared where said mouthful had been. Thereupon
quoth to him one sitting by his side, “Praised be Allah for not
making me meat between thy hands; for thou hast cleared the
dish at a single mouthful;” and quoth the Hashish-eater, “Let
him eat; methinks he hath a hanging face.” Then, turning to
Jawan he added, “Eat and Allah give thee small good of it.” So
Jawan put out his hand again and taking another mouthful, was
rolling it in his palm like the first, when behold, the Queen cried
out to the guards saying, “Bring me yonder man in haste and let
him not eat the mouthful in his hand.” So they ran and seizing
him as he hung over the dish, brought him to her, and set him in
her presence, whilst the people exulted over his mishap and said
one to the other, “Serve him right, for we warned him, but he
would not take warning. Verily, this place is bound to be the death
of whoso sitteth therein, and yonder rice bringeth doom to all who
eat of it.” Then said Queen Zumurrud to Jawan, “What is thy
name and trade and wherefore comest thou to our city?” Answered
he, “O our lord the Sultan, my name is Othman; I work
as a gardener and am come hither in quest of somewhat I have
lost.” Quoth Zumurrud, “Here with a table of sand!” So they
brought it, and she took the pen and drawing a geomantic scheme,
considered it awhile, then raising her head, exclaimed, “Woe to
thee, thou losel! How darest thou lie to Kings? This sand
<span class="pageno" id="Page_218">218</span>telleth me that of a truth thy name is Jawan the Kurd and
that thou art by trade a robber, taking men’s goods in the way
of unright and slaying those whom Allah hath forbidden to slay
save for just cause.” And she cried out upon him, saying, “O
hog, tell me the truth of thy case or I will cut off thy head on the
spot.” Now when he heard these words, he turned yellow and his
teeth chattered; then, deeming that he might save himself by truth-telling,
he replied, “O King, thou sayest sooth; but I repent at
thy hands henceforth and turn to Allah Almighty!” She answered,
“It were not lawful for me to leave a pest in the way of
Moslems;” and cried to her guards, “Take him and skin him
and do with him as last month ye did by his like.” They obeyed
her commandment; and, when the Hashish-eater saw the soldiers
seize the man, he turned his back upon the dish of rice, saying,
“’Tis a sin to present my face to thee!” And after they had
made an end of eating, they dispersed to their several homes and
Zumurrud returned to her palace and dismissed her attendants.
Now when the fourth month came round, they went to the race-course
and made the banquet, according to custom, and the folk
sat awaiting leave to begin. Presently Queen Zumurrud entered;
and, sitting down on her throne, looked at the tables and saw that
room for four people was left void before the dish of rice, at which
she wondered. Now as she was looking around, behold, she saw
a man come trotting in at the gate of the horse-course; and he
stayed not till he stood over the food-trays; and, finding no room,
save before the dish of rice, took his seat there. She looked at
him and knowing him for the accursed Christian who called himself
Rashid al-Din, said in her mind, “How blessed is this device
of the food,<a id="r312"></a><a href="#f312" class="c014"><sup>[312]</sup></a> into whose toils this infidel hath fallen!” Now the
cause of his coming was extraordinary, and it was on this wise.
When he returned from his travels——And Shahrazad perceived
the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say.</p>

<div>

<div class="nf-center-c1">
<div class="nf-center c005">
    <div>Now when it was the Three Hundred and Twenty-third Night,</div>
  </div>
</div>

</div>

<p class="c000">She said, it hath reached me, O auspicious King, that when the
accursed, who had called himself Rashid Al-Din, returned from
travel, his household informed him that Zumurrud was missing
<span class="pageno" id="Page_219">219</span>and with her a pair of saddle-bags full of money; on hearing
which ill tidings he rent his raiment and buffetted his face and
plucked out his beard. Then he despatched his brother Barsum
in quest of her to lands adjoining and, when he was weary of
awaiting news of him, he went forth himself, to seek for him
and for the girl, whenas fate led him to the city of Zumurrud.
He entered it on the first day of the month and finding the
streets deserted and the shops shut and women idling at the
windows, he asked them the reason why, and they told him that
the King made a banquet on the first of each month for the
people, all of whom were bound to attend it, nor might any
abide in his house or shop that day; and they directed him
to the racing-plain. So he betook himself thither and found
the people crowding about the food, and there was never a
place for him save in front of the rice-dish now well-known.
Here then he sat and put forth his hand to eat thereof, whereupon
Zumurrud cried out to her guards, saying, “Bring me him
who sitteth over against the dish of rice.” So they knew him
by what had before happened and laid hands on him and brought
him before Queen Zumurrud, who said to him, “Out on thee!
What is thy name and trade, and what bringeth thee to our
city?” Answered he, “O King of the age, my name is Rustam<a id="r313"></a><a href="#f313" class="c014"><sup>[313]</sup></a>
and I have no occupation, for I am a poor dervish.” Then said
she to her attendants, “Bring me table of sand and pen of
brass.” So they brought her what she sought, as of wont; and
she took the pen and made the dots which formed the figure
and considered it awhile, then raising her head to Rashid al-Din,
she said, “O dog, how darest thou lie to Kings? Thy name is
Rashid al-Din the Nazarene, thou art outwardly a Moslem, but
a Christian at heart, and thine occupation is to lay snares for
the slave-girls of the Moslems and make them captives. Speak
the truth, or I will smite off thy head.” He hesitated and stammered,
then replied, “Thou sayest sooth, O King of the age!”
Whereupon she commanded to throw him down and give him
an hundred blows with a stick on each sole and a thousand
stripes with a whip on his body; after which she bade flay him
and stuff his skin with hards of flax and dig a pit without the
city, wherein they should burn his corpse and cast on his ashes
offal and ordure. They did as she bade them and she gave
<span class="pageno" id="Page_220">220</span>the people leave to eat. So they ate and when they had eaten
their fill they went their ways, while Queen Zumurrud returned
to her palace, saying, “I thank Allah for solacing my heart of
those who wronged me.” Then she praised the Creator of the
earth and the heavens and repeated these couplets:—</p>

<div class="lg-container-b c003">
  <div class="linegroup">
    <div class="group">
      <div class="line">They ruled awhile and theirs was harsh tyrannic rule, ✿ But soon that rule went by as though it never were:</div>
      <div class="line">If just they had won justice; but they sinned, and so ✿ The world collected all its bane for them to bear:</div>
      <div class="line">So died they and their case’s tongue declares aloud ✿ This is for that; so of the world your blaming spare.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class="c000">And when her verse was ended she called to mind her lord
Ali Shar and wept flowing tears; but presently recovered herself
and said, “Haply Allah, who hath given mine enemies into my
hand, will vouchsafe me the speedy return of my beloved;” and
she begged forgiveness of Allah (be He extolled and exalted!),——And
Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say
her permitted say.</p>

<div>

<div class="nf-center-c1">
<div class="nf-center c005">
    <div>Now when it was the Three Hundred and Twenty-fourth Night,</div>
  </div>
</div>

</div>

<p class="c000">She said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that the Queen
begged forgiveness of Allah (be He extolled and exalted!), and
said, “Haply He will vouchsafe me speedy reunion with my
beloved Ali Shar for He can do what He willeth and to His
servants showeth grace, ever mindful of their case!” Then she
praised Allah and again besought forgiveness of Him, submitting
herself to the decrees of destiny, assured that each beginning
hath his end, and repeating the saying of the poet:—</p>

<div class="lg-container-b c003">
  <div class="linegroup">
    <div class="group">
      <div class="line">Take all things easy; for all worldly things ✿ In Allah’s hand are ruled by Destiny:</div>
      <div class="line">Ne’er shall befal thee aught of things forbidden, ✿ Nor what is bidden e’er shall fail to thee!</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class="c000">And what another saith:—</p>

<div class="lg-container-b c003">
  <div class="linegroup">
    <div class="group">
      <div class="line">Roll up thy days<a id="r314"></a><a href="#f314" class="c014"><sup>[314]</sup></a> and easy shall they roll ✿ Through life, nor haunt the house of grief and dole:</div>
      <div class="line">Full many a thing, which is o’er hard to find, ✿ Next hour shall bring thee to delight thy soul.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class="c000"><span class="pageno" id="Page_221">221</span>And what a third saith<a id="r315"></a><a href="#f315" class="c014"><sup>[315]</sup></a>:—</p>

<div class="lg-container-b c003">
  <div class="linegroup">
    <div class="group">
      <div class="line">Be mild what time thou ‘rt ta’en with anger and despite ✿ And patient, if there fall misfortune on thy head.</div>

    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class="c000">And what a fourth saith:—</p>

<div class="lg-container-b c003">
  <div class="linegroup">
    <div class="group">
      <div class="line">Take patience which breeds good if patience thou can learn; ✿ Be calm-souled, scaping anguish-draughts that gripe and bren:</div>
      <div class="line">Know, that if patience with good grace thou dare refuse, ✿ With ill-graced patience thou shalt bear what wrote the Pen.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class="c000">After which she abode thus another whole month’s space, judging
the folk and bidding and forbidding by day, and by night weeping
and bewailing her separation from her lord Ali Shar. On the first
day of the fifth month, she bade them spread the banquet on the
race-plain, according to custom, and sat down at the head of the
tables, whilst the lieges awaited the signal to fail to, leaving the
place before the dish of rice vacant. She sat with eyes fixed upon
the gate of the horse-course, noting all who entered and saying
in her soul, “O Thou who restoredest Joseph to Jacob and diddest
away the sorrows of Job,<a id="r316"></a><a href="#f316" class="c014"><sup>[316]</sup></a> vouchsafe of Thy might and Thy
majesty to restore me my lord Ali Shar; for Thou over all things
art Omnipotent, O Lord of the Worlds! O Guide of those who
go astray! O Hearer of those that cry! O Answerer of those who
pray, answer Thou my prayer, O Lord of all creatures.” Now
hardly had she made an end of her prayer and supplication when
behold, she saw entering the gate of the horse-plain a young
man, in shape like a willow branch, the comeliest of youths and
the most accomplished, save that his face was wan and his form
wasted by weariness. Now as he entered and came up to the
tables, he found no seat vacant save that over against the dish of
<span class="pageno" id="Page_222">222</span>sweet rice so he sat down there; and, when Zumurrud looked
upon him, her heart fluttered and, observing him narrowly, she
knew him for her lord Ali Shar, and was like to have cried out
for joy, but restrained herself, fearing disgrace before the folk;
and, albeit her bowels yearned over him and her heart beat
wildly, she hid what she felt. Now the cause of his coming
thither was on this wise. After he fell asleep upon the bench
and Zumurrud let herself down to him and Jawan the Kurd
seized her, he presently awoke and found himself lying with his
head bare, so he knew that some one had come upon him and
had robbed him of his turband whilst he slept. So he spoke the
saying which shall never shame its sayer and, which is, “Verily,
we are Allah’s and to Him are we returning!” and, going back
to the old woman’s house, knocked at the door. She came out
and he wept before her, till he fell down in a fainting fit. Now
when he came to himself, he told her all that had passed, and she
blamed him and chid him for his foolish doings saying, “Verily
thine affliction and calamity come from thyself.” And she gave
not over reproaching him, till the blood streamed from his
nostrils and he again fainted away. When he recovered from
his swoon——And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and
ceased to say her permitted say.</p>

<div>

<div class="nf-center-c1">
<div class="nf-center c005">
    <div>Now when it was the Three Hundred and Twenty-fifth Night,</div>
  </div>
</div>

</div>

<p class="c000">She said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that when Ali
Shar recovered from his swoon he saw the old woman bewailing
his griefs and weeping over him; so he complained of his hard
lot and repeated these two couplets:—</p>

<div class="lg-container-b c003">
  <div class="linegroup">
    <div class="group">
      <div class="line">How bitter to friends is a parting, ✿ And a meeting how sweet to the lover!</div>
      <div class="line">Allah join all the lovers He parteth, ✿ And save me who of love ne’er recover.<a id="r317"></a><a href="#f317" class="c014"><sup>[317]</sup></a></div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class="c000">The old woman mourned over him and said to him, “Sit here,
whilst I go in quest of news for thee and return to thee in haste.”
“To hear is to obey,” answered he. So she left him on her good
errand and was absent till midday, when she returned and said to
him, “O Ali, I fear me thou must die in thy grief; thou wilt never
<span class="pageno" id="Page_223">223</span>see thy beloved again save on the bridge Al-Sirát;<a id="r318"></a><a href="#f318" class="c014"><sup>[318]</sup></a> for the people
of the Christian’s house, when they arose in the morning, found the
window giving on the garden torn from its hinges and Zumurrud
missing, and with her a pair of saddle-bags full of the Christian’s
money. And when I came thither, I saw the Chief of Police
standing at the door, he and his many, and there is no Majesty
and there is no Might save in Allah, the Glorious, the Great!”
Now, as Ali Shar heard these words, the light in his sight was
changed to the darkness of night and he despaired of life and
made sure of death; nor did he leave weeping, till he lost his
senses. When he revived, love and longing were sore upon him;
there befel him a grievous sickness and he kept his house a
whole year; during which the old woman ceased not to bring
him doctors and ply him with ptisanes and diet-drinks and make
him savoury broths till, after the twelve-month ended, his life
returned to him. Then he recalled what had passed and repeated
these couplets:—</p>

<div class="lg-container-b c003">
  <div class="linegroup">
    <div class="group">
      <div class="line">Severance-grief nighmost, union done to death, ✿ Down-railing tear-drops, heart fire tortureth!</div>
      <div class="line">Redoubleth pine in one that hath no peace ✿ For love and wake and woe he suffereth:</div>
      <div class="line">O Lord, if there be thing to joy my soul ✿ Deign Thou bestow it while I breathe my breath.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class="c000">When the second year began, the old woman said to him, “O my
son, all this thy weeping and wailing will not bring thee back thy
mistress. Rise, therefore, gird the loins of resolution and seek for
<span class="pageno" id="Page_224">224</span>her in the lands: peradventure thou shalt light on some news of
her.” And she ceased not to exhort and hearten him, till he took
courage and she carried him to the Hammam. Then she made
him drink strong wine and eat white meats, and thus she did with
him for a whole month, till he regained strength; and setting out,
journeyed without ceasing till he arrived at Zumurrud’s city, where
he went to the horse-course, and sat down before the dish of sweet
rice and put out his hand to eat of it. Now when the folk saw
this, they were concerned for him and said to him, “O young
man, eat not of that dish, for whoso eateth thereof, misfortune
befalleth him.” Answered he, “Leave me to eat of it, and let
them do with me what they will, so haply shall I be at rest from
this wearying life.” Accordingly he ate a first mouthful, and
Zumurrud was minded to have him brought before her; but
then she bethought her that belike he was anhungered and said
to herself, “It were properer to let him eat his fill.” So he went
on eating, whilst the folk looked at him in astonishment, waiting
to see what would betide him; and, when he had satisfied himself,
Zumurrud said to certain of her eunuchry, “Go to yonder
youth who eateth of the rice and bring him to me in courteous
guise, saying:—Answer the summons of the King who would
have a word with thee on some slight matter.” They replied,
“We hear and obey,” and going straightways up to Ali Shar,
said to him, “O my lord, be pleased to answer the summons of
the King and let thy heart be at ease.” Quoth he, “Hearkening
and obedience;” and followed the eunuchs,——And Shahrazad
perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say.</p>

<p class="c000">She said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that Ali Shar
rejoined, “Hearkening and obedience;” and followed the eunuchs,
whilst the people said to one another, “There is no Majesty and
there is no Might save in Allah, the Glorious, the Great! I wonder
what the King will do with him!” And others said, “He will do
him naught but good: for had he intended to harm him, he had
not suffered him to eat his fill.” Now when the Castratos set him
in presence of Zumurrud he saluted and kissed the earth before
her, whilst she returned his salutation and received him with
honour. Then she asked him, “What may be thy name and
trade, and what brought thee to our city?”; and he answered, “O
<span class="pageno" id="Page_225">225</span>King my name is Ali Shar; I am of the sons of the merchants of
Khorasan; and the cause of my coming hither is to seek for a
slave-girl whom I have lost for she was dearer to me than my
hearing and my seeing, and indeed my soul cleaveth to her, since
I lost her; and such is my tale.” So saying he wept, till he
swooned away; whereupon she bade them sprinkle rose-water on
his face, which they did till he revived, when she said, “Here with
the table of sand and the brass pen.” So they brought them and
she took the pen and struck a geomantic scheme which she considered
awhile; and then cried, “Thou hast spoken sooth, Allah
will grant thee speedy reunion with her; so be not troubled.”
Upon this she commanded her head-chamberlain to carry him to
the bath and afterwards to clothe him in a handsome suit of royal
apparel, and mount him on one of the best of the King’s horses
and finally bring him to the palace at the last of the day. So the
Chamberlain, after saying “I hear and I obey,” took him away;
whilst the folk began to say to one another, “What maketh the
King deal thus courteously with yonder youth?” And quoth
one, “Did I not tell you that he would do him no hurt?; for he is
fair of aspect; and this I knew, ever since the King suffered him
to eat his fill.” And each said his say; after which they all
dispersed and went their ways. As for Zumurrud, she thought
the night would never come, that she might be alone with the
beloved of her heart. As soon as it was dark, she withdrew to
her sleeping-chamber and made her attendants think her overcome
with sleep; and it was her wont to suffer none to pass the night
with her save those two little eunuchs who waited upon her.
After a while when she had composed herself, she sent for her
dear Ali Shar and sat down upon the bed, with candles burning
over her head and feet, and hanging lamps of gold lighting up the
place like the rising sun. When the people heard of her sending
for Ali Shar, they marvelled thereat and each man thought his
thought and said his say; but one of them declared, “At all
events the King is in love with this young man, and to-morrow he
will make him generalissimo of the army.”<a id="r319"></a><a href="#f319" class="c014"><sup>[319]</sup></a> Now when they
<span class="pageno" id="Page_226">226</span>brought him into her, he kissed the ground between her hands and
called down blessings on her, and she said in her mind, “There is
no help for it but that I jest with him awhile, before I make
myself known to him.”<a id="r320"></a><a href="#f320" class="c014"><sup>[320]</sup></a> Then she asked him, “O Ali, say me,
hast thou been to the Hammam?”<a id="r321"></a><a href="#f321" class="c014"><sup>[321]</sup></a> and he answered, “Yes, O my
lord.” Quoth she, “Come, eat of this chicken and meat, and
drink of this wine and sherbet of sugar; for thou art weary; and
after that come thou hither.” “I hear and I obey,” replied he,
and did as she commanded him do. Now when he had made an
end of eating and drinking, she said to him, “Come up with me on
the couch and shampoo<a id="r322"></a><a href="#f322" class="c014"><sup>[322]</sup></a> my feet.” So he fell to rubbing feet
and kneading calves, and found them softer than silk. Then said
she, “Go higher with the massage;” and he, “Pardon me, O my
lord, to the knee but no farther!” Whereupon quoth she, “Durst
thou disobey me?: it shall be an ill-omened night for thee!”——And
Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her

</div>

<p class="c000">She said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that Zumurrud
cried to her lord, Ali Shar, “Durst thou disobey me?: it shall be
an ill-omened night for thee! Nay, but it behoveth thee to do my
bidding and I will make thee my minion and appoint thee one of
my Emirs.” Asked Ali Shar, “And in what must I do thy
bidding, O King of the age?” and she answered, “Doff thy
trousers and lie down on thy face.” Quoth he, “That is a thing
in my life I never did; and if thou force me thereto, verily I will
accuse thee thereof before Allah on Resurrection-day. Take
everything thou hast given me and let me go from thy city.”
And he wept and lamented; but she said, “Doff thy trousers and
<span class="pageno" id="Page_227">227</span>lie down on thy face, or I will strike off thy head.” So he did as
she bade him and she mounted upon his back; and he felt what was
softer than silk and smoother than cream and said in himself, “Of
a truth, this King is nicer than all the women!” Now for a time
she abode on his back, then she turned over on the bed, and he
said to himself, “Praised be Allah! It seemeth his yard is not
standing.” Then said she, “O Ali, it is of the wont of my prickle
that it standeth not, except they rub it with their hands; so, come,
rub it with thy hand, till it be at stand, else will I slay thee.” So
saying, she lay down on her back and taking his hand, set it to her
parts, and he found these same parts softer than silk; white,
plumply-rounded, protuberant, resembling for heat the hot room of
the bath or the heart of a lover whom love-longing hath wasted.
Quoth Ali in himself, “Verily, our King hath a coynte; this is
indeed a wonder of wonders!” And lust gat hold on him and his
yard rose and stood upright to the utmost of its height; which
when Zumurrud saw, she burst out laughing and said to him, “O
my lord, all this happeneth and yet thou knowest me not!” He
asked “And who art thou, O King?”; and she answered, “I am
thy slave-girl Zumurrud.” Now whenas he knew this and was
certified that she was indeed his very slave-girl, Zumurrud, he
kissed her and embraced her and threw himself upon her as the
lion upon the lamb. Then he sheathed his steel rod in her
scabbard and ceased not to play the porter at her door and the
preacher in her pulpit and the priest<a id="r323"></a><a href="#f323" class="c014"><sup>[323]</sup></a> at her prayer-niche,
whilst she with him ceased not from inclination and prostration
and rising up and sitting down, accompanying her ejaculations of
praise and of “Glory to Allah!” with passionate movements
and wrigglings and claspings of his member<a id="r324"></a><a href="#f324" class="c014"><sup>[324]</sup></a> and other amorous
gestures, till the two little eunuchs heard the noise. So they came
and peeping from behind the curtains saw the King lying on his
back and upon him Ali Shar, thrusting and slashing whilst she
<span class="pageno" id="Page_228">228</span>puffed and blew and wriggled. Quoth they, “Verily, this be no
man’s wriggle: belike this King is a woman.”<a id="r325"></a><a href="#f325" class="c014"><sup>[325]</sup></a> But they concealed
their affair and discovered it to none. And when the
morrow came, Zumurrud summoned all the troops and the lords
of the realm and said to them, “I am minded to journey to this
man’s country; so choose you a viceroy, who shall rule over you
till I return to you.” And they answered, “We hear and we
obey.” Then she applied herself to making ready the wants of
the way, to wit provaunt and provender, monies and rarities for
presents, camels and mules and so forth; after which she set out
from her city with Ali Shar, and they ceased not faring on, till
they arrived at his native place, where he entered his house and
gave many gifts to his friends and alms and largesse to the poor.
And Allah vouchsafed him children by her, and they both lived
the gladdest and happiest of lives, till there came to them the
Destroyer of delights and the Severer of societies and the
Garnerer of graves. And glorified be He the Eternal without
cease, and praised be He in every case! And amongst other tales

Fescennine than Kara Gyuz, who appeared with a phallus longer than himself and made
all the Consuls-General periodically complain of its abuse; while the dialogue, mostly
in Turkish, was even more obscene. Most ingenious were Kara Gyuz’s little ways of
driving on an obstinate donkey and of tackling a huge Anatolian pilgrim. He mounted
the Neddy’s back, face to tail, and inserting his left thumb like a clyster, hammered it with
his right, when the donkey started at speed. For the huge pilgrim he used a ladder.

black dyes because these make them look younger and fiercer. Henna stains white
hair orange red; and the Persians apply after it a paste of indigo leaves; the result is
successively leek-green, emerald-green, bottle-green and lastly lamp-black. There is
a stage in life (the youth of old age) when man uses dyes: presently he finds that the

called it Pul-i-Chinávar or Chinávad and the Jews borrowed it from them as they did
all their fancies of a future life against which Moses had so gallantly fought. It is said
that a bridge over the grisly “brook Kedron” was called Sirát (the road) and hence
the idea, as that of hell-fire from Ge-Hinnom (Gehenna) where children were passed
through the fire to Moloch. A doubtful Hadis says, “The Prophet declared Al-Sirát
to be the name of a bridge over hell-fire, dividing Hell from Paradise” (pp. 17, 122,
Reynold’s trans. of Al-Siyuti’s Traditions, etc.). In Koran i. 5, “Sirát” is simply a
path, from sarata, he swallowed, even as the way devours (makes a lakam or mouthful
of) those who travel it. The word was orig. written with Sín but changed for easier
articulation to Sád, one of the four Hurúf al-Mutabbakát (<span xml:lang="ar" lang="ar">ط</span>, <span xml:lang="ar" lang="ar">ض</span>, <span xml:lang="ar" lang="ar">ص</span> and <span xml:lang="ar" lang="ar">ظ</span>), “the

  <h2 id="c228" class="c007">THE LOVES OF JUBAYR BIN UMAYR AND THE LADY BUDUR.</h2>
</div>

<p class="c013">It is related that the Commander of the Faithful, Harun al-Rashid
was uneasy<a id="r326"></a><a href="#f326" class="c014"><sup>[326]</sup></a> one night and could not sleep; so that he ceased not
to toss from side to side for very restlessness, till, growing weary of
this, he called Masrur and said to him, “Ho, Masrur, find me some
one who may solace me in this my wakefulness.” He answered,
“O Prince of True Believers, wilt thou walk in the palace-garden
and divert thyself with the sight of its blooms and gaze upon the
stars and constellations and note the beauty of their ordinance
<span class="pageno" id="Page_229">229</span>and the moon among them rising in sheen over the water?”
Quoth the Caliph, “O Masrur, my heart inclineth not to aught of
this.” Quoth he, “O my lord, there are in thy palace three
hundred concubines, each of whom hath her separate chamber.
Do thou bid all and every retire into her own apartment and then
do thou go thy rounds and amuse thyself with gazing on them
without their knowledge.” The Caliph replied, “O Masrur, the
palace is my palace and the girls are my property: furthermore my
soul inclineth not to aught of this.” Then Masrur rejoined, “O my
lord, summon the doctors of law and religion and the sages of
science and poets, and bid them contend before thee in argument
and disputation and recite to thee songs and verses and tell thee
tales and anecdotes.” Replied the Caliph, “My soul inclineth not
to aught of this;” and Masrur rejoined, “O my lord, bid pretty
boys and the wits and the cup-companions attend thee and solace
thee with witty sallies.” “O Masrur,” ejaculated the Caliph,
“indeed my soul inclineth not to aught of this.” “Then, O my
lord,” cried Masrur, “strike off my head;”——And Shahrazad
perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say.</p>

<div class="nf-center c005">
    <div>Now when it was the Three Hundred and Twenty-eighth Night,</div>
  </div>

</div>

<p class="c000">She said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that Masrur
cried out to the Caliph, “O my lord, strike off my head; haply
that will dispel thine unease and do away the restlessness that is
upon thee.” So Al-Rashid laughed at his saying and said, “See
which of the boon-companions is at the door.” Thereupon he went
out and returning, said, “O my lord, he who sits without is Ali bin
Mansur of Damascus, the Wag.”<a id="r327"></a><a href="#f327" class="c014"><sup>[327]</sup></a> “Bring him to me,” quoth
Harun: and Masrur went out and returned with Ibn Mansur, who
said, on entering, “Peace be with thee, O Commander of the
Faithful!” The Caliph returned his salutation and said to him,
“O Ibn Mansur, tell us some of thy stories.” Said the other, “O
Commander of the Faithful, shall I tell thee what I have seen with
my eyes or what I have only heard tell?” Replied the Caliph, “If
thou have seen aught worth telling, let us hear it; for hearing is
not like seeing.” Said Ibn Mansur, “O Commander of the
<span class="pageno" id="Page_230">230</span>Faithful, lend me thine ear and thy heart;” and he answered, “O
Ibn Mansur, behold, I am listening to thee with mine ears and
looking at thee with mine eyes and attending to thee with my
heart.” So Ibn Mansur began:—Know then, O Commander of
the Faithful, that I receive a yearly allowance from Mohammed
bin Sulaymán al-Háshimi, Sultan of Bassorah; so I went to him,
once upon a time, as usual, and found him ready to ride out
hunting and birding. I saluted him and he returned my salute,
and said, “O son of Mansur, mount and come with us to the
chase:” but I said, “O my lord, I can no longer ride; so do thou
station me in the guest-house and give thy chamberlains and
lieutenants charge over me.” And he did so and departed for his
sport. His people entreated me with the utmost honour and
entertained me with the greatest hospitality; but said I to myself,
“By Allah, it is a strange thing that for so long I have been in the
habit of coming from Baghdad to Bassorah, yet know no more of
this town than from palace to garden and from garden to palace;
When shall I find an occasion like this to view the different parts
and quarters of Bassorah? I will rise forthwith and walk forth
alone and divert myself and digest what I have eaten.” Accordingly
I donned my richest dress and went out a-walking about
Bassorah. Now it is known to thee, O Commander of the Faithful,
that it hath seventy streets, each seventy leagues<a id="r328"></a><a href="#f328" class="c014"><sup>[328]</sup></a> long, the
measure of Irak; and I lost myself in its by-streets and thirst
overcame me. Presently, as I went along, O Prince of True Believers,
behold, I came to a great door, whereon were two rings of
brass,<a id="r329"></a><a href="#f329" class="c014"><sup>[329]</sup></a> with curtains of red brocade drawn before it. And on
either side of the door was a stone bench and over it was a trellis,
covered with a creeping vine that hung down and shaded the doorway.
I stood still to gaze upon the place, and presently heard a
sorrowful voice, proceeding from a heart which did not rejoice,
singing melodiously and chanting these cinquains:—</p>

<div class="lg-container-b c003">

  </div>
</div>

<p class="c000">Quoth I to myself, “Verily, if the owner of this voice be fair, she
conjoineth beauty of person and eloquence and sweetness of voice.”
Then I drew near the door, and began raising the curtain little by
little, when lo! I beheld a damsel, white as a full moon when it
mooneth on its fourteenth night, with joined eyebrows twain and
languorous lids of eyne, breasts like pomegranates twin and dainty
lips like double carnelian, a mouth as it were the seal of Solomon,
and teeth ranged in a line that played with the reason of proser
and rhymer, even as saith the poet:—</p>

<div class="lg-container-b c003">
  <div class="linegroup">
    <div class="group">
      <div class="line">O pearly mouth of friend, who set those pretty pearls in line, ✿ And filled thee full of whitest chamomile and reddest wine?</div>
      <div class="line">Who lent the morning-glory in thy smile to shimmer and shine ✿ Who with that ruby-padlock dared thy lips to seal and sign!</div>
      <div class="line">Who looks on thee at early morn with stress of joy and bliss ✿ Goes mad for aye, what then of him who wins a kiss of thine?</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class="c000">And as saith another:—</p>

<div class="lg-container-b c003">
  <div class="linegroup">
    <div class="group">
      <div class="line">O pearl-set mouth of friend ✿ Pity poor Ruby’s cheek;</div>
      <div class="line">Boast not o’er one who owns ✿ Thee, union and unique.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class="c000">In brief she comprised all varieties of loveliness and was a seduction
to men and women, nor could the gazer satisfy himself with the
sight of her charms; for she was as the poet hath said of her:—</p>

<div class="lg-container-b c003">
  <div class="linegroup">
    <div class="group">
      <div class="line"><span class="pageno" id="Page_232">232</span>When comes she, slays she; and when back she turns, ✿ She makes all men regard with loving eyes:</div>
      <div class="line">A very sun! a very moon! but still ✿ From hurt and harmful ills her nature flies.</div>
      <div class="line">Opes Eden’s garden when she shows herself; ✿ And full moon see we o’er her necklace rise.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class="c000">Now as I was looking at her through an opening of the curtain,
behold, she turned; and, seeing me standing at the door, said to
her handmaid, “See who is at the door.” So the slave-girl came
up to me and said, “O Shaykh, hast thou no shame, or do impudent
airs suit hoary hairs?” Quoth I, “O my mistress, I confess
to the hoary hairs, but as for impudent airs, I think not to be
guilty of unmannerliness.” Then the mistress broke in, “And
what can be more unmannerly than to intrude thyself upon a house
other than thy house and gaze on a Harim other than thy Harim?”
I pleaded, “O my lady, I have an excuse;” and when she asked,
“And what is thine excuse?” I answered, “I am a stranger and
so thirsty that I am well-nigh dead of thirst.” She rejoined, “We
accept thine excuse,”——And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of
day and ceased to say her permitted say.</p>

<p class="c000">She said, it hath reached me, O auspicious King, that the young
lady rejoined, “We accept thine excuse,” and calling one of her
slave-maids, said to her, “O Lutf,<a id="r331"></a><a href="#f331" class="c014"><sup>[331]</sup></a> give him to drink in the golden
tankard.” So she brought me a tankard of red gold, set with
pearls and gems of price, full of water mingled with virgin musk
and covered with a napkin of green silk; and I addressed myself
to drink and was long about my drinking, for I stole glances at her
the while, till I could prolong my stay no longer. Then I returned
the tankard to the girl, but did not offer to go; and she said to me,
“O Shaykh, wend thy way.” But I said, “O my lady, I am
troubled in mind.” She asked me “For what?” and I answered,
“For the turns of Time and the change of things.” Replied she,
“Well mayst thou be troubled thereat for Time breedeth wonders.
But what hast thou seen of such surprises that thou shouldst muse
<span class="pageno" id="Page_233">233</span>upon them?” Quoth I, “I was thinking of the whilom owner of
this house, for he was my intimate in his lifetime.” Asked she,
“What was his name?”; and I answered, “Mohammed bin Ali
the Jeweller and he was a man of great wealth. Tell me did he
leave any children?” Said she, “Yes, he left a daughter, Budur
by name, who inherited all his wealth?.” Quoth I, “Meseemeth
thou art his daughter?” “Yes,” answered she, laughing; then
added, “O Shaykh, thou hast talked long enough; now wend
thy ways.” Replied I, “Needs must I go, but I see thy charms
are changed by being out of health; so tell me thy case; it may
be Allah will give thee comfort at my hands.” Rejoined she, “O
Shaykh, if thou be a man of discretion, I will discover to thee my
secret; but first tell me who thou art, that I may know whether
thou art worthy of confidence or not; for the poet saith:<a id="r332"></a><a href="#f332" class="c014"><sup>[332]</sup></a>—</p>

<p class="c000">Thereto I replied, “O my lady, an thou wouldest know who I am,

she heard my name, she came down from her seat and saluting me,
said, “Welcome, O Ibn Mansur! Now will I tell thee my case and
entrust thee with my secret. I am a lover separated from her
beloved.” I answered, “O my lady, thou art fair and shouldest be
on love-terms with none but the fair. Whom then dost thou love?”
Quoth she, “I love Jubayr bin Umayr al-Shaybáni, Emir of the
Banú Shaybán;<a id="r333"></a><a href="#f333" class="c014"><sup>[333]</sup></a>” and she described to me a young man than
whom there was no prettier fellow in Bassorah. I asked, “O my
lady, have interviews or letters passed between you?” and she
answered, “Yes, but our love was tongue-love, not heart and soul-love;
for he kept not his trust nor was he faithful to his troth.”
Said I, “O my lady, and what was the cause of your separation?”;
and she replied, “I was sitting one day whilst my handmaid here
combed my hair. When she had made an end of combing it, she
plaited my tresses, and my beauty and loveliness charmed her; so
<span class="pageno" id="Page_234">234</span>she bent over me and kissed my cheek.<a id="r334"></a><a href="#f334" class="c014"><sup>[334]</sup></a> At that moment he came
in unawares, and, seeing the girl kiss my cheek, straightways
turned away in anger, vowing eternal separation and repeating
these two couplets:—</p>

<div class="lg-container-b c003">
  <div class="linegroup">
    <div class="group">
      <div class="line">If another share in the thing I love, ✿ I abandon my love and live lorn of love.</div>
      <div class="line">My beloved is worthless if aught she will, ✿ Save that which her lover doth most approve.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class="c000">And from the time he left me to this present hour, O Ibn Mansur,
he hath neither written to me nor answered my letters.” Quoth I,
“And what purposest thou to do?” Quoth she, “I have a mind
to send him a letter by thee. If thou bring me back an answer,
thou shalt have of me five hundred gold pieces; and if not, then
an hundred for thy trouble in going and coming.” I answered,
“Do what seemeth good to thee; I hear and I obey thee.”
Whereupon she called to one of her slave-girls, “Bring me inkcase
and paper,” and she wrote thereon these couplets:—</p>

<div class="lg-container-b c003">
  <div class="linegroup">
    <div class="group">
      <div class="line">Beloved, why this strangeness, why this hate? ✿ When shall thy pardon reunite us two?</div>
      <div class="line">Why dost thou turn from me in severance? ✿ Thy face is not the face I am wont to know.</div>
      <div class="line">Yes, slanderers falsed my words, and thou to them ✿ Inclining, madest spite and envy grow.</div>
      <div class="line">An hast believed their tale, the Heavens forbid ✿ Now thou believe it when dost better trow!</div>
      <div class="line">By thy life tell what hath reached thine ear; ✿ Thou know’st what said they and so justice show.</div>
      <div class="line">An it be true I spoke the words, my words ✿ Admit interpreting and change allow:</div>
      <div class="line">Given that the words of Allah were revealed, ✿ Folk changed the Torah<a id="r335"></a><a href="#f335" class="c014"><sup>[335]</sup></a> and still changing go:</div>
      <div class="line">What slanders told they of mankind before! ✿ Jacob heard Joseph blamed by tongue of foe.</div>
      <div class="line">Yea, for myself and slanderer and thee ✿ An awful day of reckoning there shall be.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class="c000"><span class="pageno" id="Page_235">235</span>Then she sealed the letter and gave it to me; and I took it and
carried it to the house of Jubayr bin Umayr, whom I found absent
a-hunting. So I sat down to wait for him; and behold, he returned
from the chase; and when I saw him, O Prince of True Believers,
come riding up, my wit was confounded by his beauty and grace.
As soon as he sighted me sitting at the house-door, he dismounted
and coming up to me embraced me and saluted me; and meseemed
I embraced the world and all therein. Then he carried me into his
house and, seating me on his own couch, called for food. They
brought a table of Khalanj-wood of Khorasan with feet of gold,
whereon were all manners of meats, fried and roasted and the
like. So I seated myself at the table and examining it with care
found these couplets engraved upon it:<a id="r336"></a><a href="#f336" class="c014"><sup>[336]</sup></a>——And Shahrazad perceived

<p class="c000">Then said Jubayr, “Put forth thy hand to our food and ease our
heart by eating of our victual.” Answered I, “By Allah, I will not
eat a mouthful, till thou grant me my desire.” He asked, “What
is thy desire?”; so I brought out the letter and gave it to him; but,
when he had read it and mastered its contents, he tore it in pieces
and throwing it on the floor, said to me, “O Ibn Mansur, I will
grant thee whatever thou askest save thy desire which concerneth
the writer of this letter, for I have no answer to her.” At this I
rose in anger; but he caught hold of my skirts, saying, “O Ibn
Mansur, I will tell thee what she said to thee, albeit I was not
present with you.” I asked, “And what did she say to me?”;
and he answered, “Did not the writer of this letter say to thee, If
thou bring me back an answer, thou shalt have of me five hundred
ducats; and if not, an hundred for thy pains?” “Yes,” replied
I; and he rejoined, “Abide with me this day and eat and drink
and enjoy thyself and make merry, and thou shalt have thy five
hundred ducats.” So I sat with him and ate and drank and made
<span class="pageno" id="Page_237">237</span>merry and enjoyed myself and entertained him with talk deep into
the night;<a id="r338"></a><a href="#f338" class="c014"><sup>[338]</sup></a> after which I said to him, “O my master, is there
no music in thy house.” He answered, “Verily for many a day we
have drunk without music.” Then he called out, saying, “Ho,
Shajarat al-Durr!” Whereupon a slave-girl answered him from her
chamber and came in to us, with a lute of Hindu make, wrapped in
a silken bag. And she sat down and, laying the lute in her lap,
preluded in one-and-twenty modes; then, returning to the first,
she sang to a lively measure these couplets:—</p>

<div class="lg-container-b c003">
  <div class="linegroup">
    <div class="group">
      <div class="line">Whoso ne’er tasted of Love’s sweets and bitter draught, ✿ No difference kens ‘twixt presence-bliss and absence-stress;</div>
      <div class="line">And so, who hath declined from Love’s true road, ✿ No difference kens ‘twixt smooth and ruggedness:</div>
      <div class="line">I ceased not to oppose the votaries of love, ✿ Till I had tried its sweets and bitters not the less:</div>
      <div class="line">How many a night my pretty friend conversed with me ✿ And sipped I from his lips honey of love-liesse:</div>
      <div class="line">Now have I drunk its cup of bitterness, until ✿ To bondman and to freedman I have proved me base.</div>
      <div class="line">How short-aged was the night together we enjoyed, ✿ When seemed it day break came on nightfall’s heel to press!</div>
      <div class="line">But Fate had vowed to disunite us lovers twain, ✿ And she too well hath kept her vow, that votaress.</div>
      <div class="line">Fate so decreed it! None her sentence can withstand: ✿ Where is the wight who dares oppose his Lord’s command?</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class="c000">Hardly had she finished her verses, when her lord cried out with a
great cry and fell down in a fit; whereupon exclaimed the damsel,
“May Allah not punish thee, O old man! This long time have
we drunk without music, for fear the like of this falling sickness
befal our lord. But now go thou to yonder chamber and there
sleep.” So I went to the chamber which she showed me and
slept till the morning, when behold, a page brought me a purse
of five hundred dinars and said to me, “This is what my master
promised thee; but return thou not to the damsel who sent thee,
and let it be as though neither thou nor we had ever heard of this
matter.” “Hearkening and obedience,” answered I and taking the
<span class="pageno" id="Page_238">238</span>purse, went my way. Still I said to myself, “The lady must have
expected me since yesterday; and by Allah there is no help but
I return to her and tell her what passed between me and him:
otherwise she will revile me and revile all who come from my
country.” So I went to her and found her standing behind the
door; and when she saw me she said, “O Ibn Mansur, thou hast
done nothing for me!” I asked, “Who told thee of this?”; and
she answered, “O Ibn Mansur, yet another thing hath been revealed
to me;<a id="r339"></a><a href="#f339" class="c014"><sup>[339]</sup></a> and it is that, when thou handedst him the letter,
he tore it in pieces and throwing it on the floor, said to thee:—O
Ibn Mansur, I will grant thee whatever thou askest save thy desire
which concerneth the writer of this letter; for I have no answer
to her missive. Then didst thou rise from beside him in anger;
but he laid hold of thy skirts, saying:—O son of Mansur, abide
with me to-day, for thou art my guest, and eat and drink and
make merry; and thou shalt have thy five hundred ducats. So
thou didst sit with him, eating and drinking and making merry,
and entertainedst him with talk deep into the night and a slave-girl
sang such an air and such verses, whereupon he fell down in
a fit.” So, O Commander of the Faithful, I asked her “Wast thou
then with us?”; and she answered, “O Ibn Mansur, hast thou not
heard the saying of the poet:—</p>

<div class="lg-container-b c003">
  <div class="linegroup">
    <div class="group">
      <div class="line">The hearts of lovers have eyes I ken, ✿ Which see the unseen by vulgar men.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class="c000">However, O Ibn Mansur, the night and day shift not upon anything
but they bring to it change.”——And Shahrazad perceived
the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say.</p>

<div>

<div class="nf-center-c1">
<div class="nf-center c005">
    <div>Now when it was the Three Hundred and Thirty-first Night,</div>
  </div>
</div>

</div>

<p class="c000">She said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that the lady
exclaimed, “O Ibn Mansur, the night and the day shift not upon
anything but they bring to it change!” Then she raised her
glance to heaven and said, “O my God and my Leader and my
Lord, like as Thou hast afflicted me with love of Jubayr bin Umayr,
even so do Thou afflict him with love of me, and transfer the
passion from my heart to his heart!”<a id="r340"></a><a href="#f340" class="c014"><sup>[340]</sup></a> Then she gave me an
<span class="pageno" id="Page_239">239</span>hundred sequins for my trouble in going and coming and I took
it and returned to the palace, where I found the Sultan come
home from the chase; so I got my pension of him and fared back
to Baghdad. And when next year came, I repaired to Bassorah,
as usual, to seek my pension, and the Sultan paid it to me; but,
as I was about to return to Baghdad, I bethought me of the Lady
Budur and said to myself, “By Allah, I must needs go to her and
see what hath befallen between her and her lover!” So I went
to her house and finding the street before her door swept and
sprinkled and eunuchs and servants and pages standing before the
entrance, said to myself, “Most like grief hath broken the lady’s
heart and she is dead, and some Emir or other hath taken up his
abode in her house.” So I left it and went on to the house of
Jubayr, son of Umayr the Shaybani, where I found the benches
of the porch broken down and ne’er a page at the door, as of wont,
and said to myself, “Haply he too is dead.” Then I stood still
before the door of his house and with my eyes running over with
tears, bemoaned it in these couplets:—</p>

<div class="lg-container-b c003">
  <div class="linegroup">
    <div class="group">
      <div class="line">O Lords of me, who fared but whom my heart e’er followeth; ✿ Return; and so my festal days with you shall be renewed!</div>
      <div class="line">I stand before the home of you, bewailing your abode; ✿ Quiver mine eyelids and my eyes with tears are ever dewed:</div>
      <div class="line">I ask the house and its remains that seem to weep and wail, ✿ “Where is the man who whilom wont to lavish goods and good?”</div>
      <div class="line">It saith, “Go, wend thy way; those friends like 
travellers have fared ✿ From Springtide-camp, and buried lie of earth 
and worms the food!”</div>
      <div class="line">Allah ne’er desolate us so we lose their virtues’ light ✿ In length and breadth, but ever be the light in spirit viewed!</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class="c000">As I, O Prince of True Believers, was thus keening over the folk
of the house,<a id="r341"></a><a href="#f341" class="c014"><sup>[341]</sup></a> behold, out came a black slave therefrom and said
to me, “Hold thy peace, O Shaykh! May thy mother be reft of
thee! Why do I see thee bemoaning the house on this wise?”
Quoth I, “I frequented it of yore, when it belonged to a good
friend of mine.” Asked the slave, “What was his name?”; and
I answered, “Jubayr bin Umayr the Shaybani.” Rejoined he,
“And what hath befallen him? Praised be Allah, he is yet here
with us in the enjoyment of property and rank and prosperity,
<span class="pageno" id="Page_240">240</span>except that Allah hath stricken him with love of a damsel called
the Lady Budur; and he is so whelmed by his love of her and his
longing for her, that he is like a great rock cumbering the ground.
If he hunger, he saith not, Give me meat; nor, if he thirst, doth
he say, Give me drink.” Quoth I, “Ask leave for me to go in to
him.” Said the slave, “O my lord, wilt thou go in to one who
understandeth or to one who understandeth not?”; and I said,
“There is no help for it but I see him whatever be the case.”
Accordingly he went in to ask and presently returned with permission
for me to enter, whereupon I went in to Jubayr and found
him like a rock that cumbereth the ground, understanding neither
sign nor speech; and when I spoke to him he answered me not.
Then said one of his servants, “O my lord, if thou remember aught
of verse, repeat it and raise thy voice; and he will be aroused by
this and speak with thee.” So I versified in these two couplets:—</p>

<div class="lg-container-b c003">
  <div class="linegroup">
    <div class="group">
      <div class="line">Hast quit the love of Moons<a id="r342"></a><a href="#f342" class="c014"><sup>[342]</sup></a> or dost persist? ✿ Dost wake o’ nights or close in sleep thine eyes?</div>
      <div class="line">If aye thy tears in torrents flow, then learn ✿ Eternal thou shalt dwell in Paradise.<a href="#f342" class="c014"><sup>[342]</sup></a></div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class="c000">When he heard these verses he opened his eyes and said, “Welcome,
O son of Mansur! Verily, the jest is become earnest.”
Quoth I, “O my lord, is there aught thou wouldst have me do for
thee?” Answered he, “Yes, I would fain write her a letter and
send it to her by thee. If thou bring me back her answer, thou
shalt have of me a thousand dinars; and if not, two hundred for
thy pains.” So I said, “Do what seemeth good to thee;”——And
Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her
permitted say.</p>

<div>

<div class="nf-center-c1">
<div class="nf-center c005">
    <div>Now when it was the Three Hundred and Thirty-second Night,</div>
  </div>
</div>

</div>

<p class="c000">She said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that Ibn Mansur
continued:—So I said, “Do what seemeth good to thee;” whereupon
he called to one of his slave-girls, “Bring me ink case and
paper;” and wrote these couplets:—</p>

<div class="lg-container-b c003">
  <div class="linegroup">
    <div class="group">
      <div class="line"><span class="pageno" id="Page_241">241</span>I pray in Allah’s name, O Princess mine, be light ✿ On me, for Love hath robbed me of my reason’s sight!</div>
      <div class="line">‘Slaved me this longing and enthralled me love of you; ✿ And clad in sickness garb, a poor and abject wight.</div>
      <div class="line">I wont ere this to think small things of Love and hold, ✿ O Princess mine, twas silly thing and over-slight.</div>
      <div class="line">But when it showed me swelling surges of its sea, ✿ To Allah’s hest I bowed and pitied lovers’ plight.</div>
      <div class="line">An will you, pity show and deign a meeting grant; ✿ An will you, kill me still forget not good requite.<a id="r343"></a><a href="#f343" class="c014"><sup>[343]</sup></a></div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class="c000">Then he sealed the letter and gave it to me. So I took it and,
repairing to Budur’s house, raised the door-curtain little by little,
as before, and looking in behold, I saw ten damsels, high-bosomed
virgins, like moons, and the Lady Budur as she were the full moon
among the stars, sitting in their midst, or the sun, when it is clear
of clouds and mist; nor was there on her any trace of pain or care.
And as I looked and marvelled at her case, she turned her glance
upon me and, seeing me standing at the door, said to me, “Well
come, and welcome and all hail to thee, O Ibn Mansur! Come
in.” So I entered and saluting her gave her the letter; and she
read it and when she understood it, she said laughingly to me,
“O Ibn Mansur,” the poet lied not when he sang:—</p>

<div class="lg-container-b c003">
  <div class="linegroup">
    <div class="group">
      <div class="line">Indeed I’ll bear my love for thee with firmest soul, ✿ Until from thee to me shall come a messenger.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class="c000">“Look’ye, O Ibn Mansur, I will write thee an answer, that he may
give thee what he promised thee.” And I answered, “Allah
requite thee with good!” So she called out to a handmaid, “Bring
inkcase and paper,” and wrote these couplets:—</p>

<div class="lg-container-b c003">
  <div class="linegroup">
    <div class="group">
      <div class="line">How comes it I fulfilled my vow the while that vow broke you? ✿ And, seen me lean to equity, iniquity wrought you?</div>
      <div class="line">‘Twas you initiated wrongous dealing and despite: ✿ You were the treachetour and treason came from only you!</div>
      <div class="line">I never ceased to cherish mid the sons of men my troth; ✿ And keep your honour brightest bright and swear by name of you,</div>
      <div class="line">Until I saw with eyes of me what evil you had done; ✿ Until I heard with ears of me what foul report spread you.</div>
      <div class="line"><span class="pageno" id="Page_242">242</span>Shall I bring low my proper worth while raising yours so high? ✿ By Allah, had you honoured me eke I had honoured you!</div>
      <div class="line">But now uprooting severance I will fain console my heart, ✿ And wring my fingers clean of you for evermore to part!</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class="c000">Quoth I, “By Allah, O my lady, between him and death there is
but the reading of this letter!” So I tore it in pieces and said
to her, “Write him other than these lines.” “I hear and obey,”
answered she and wrote the following couplets—</p>

<div class="lg-container-b c003">
  <div class="linegroup">
    <div class="group">
      <div class="line">Indeed I am consolèd now and sleep without a tear, ✿ And all that happened slandering tongues have whispered in mine ear:</div>
      <div class="line">My heart obeyed my hest and soon forgot thy memory, ✿ And learnt mine eyelids ‘twas the best to live in severance sheer:</div>
      <div class="line">He lied who said that severance is a bitterer thing than gall: ✿ It never disappointed me; like wine I find it cheer:</div>
      <div class="line">I learnt to hate all news of thee, e’en mention of thy name, ✿ And turn away and look thereon with loathing pure and mere:</div>
      <div class="line">Lookye! I cast thee out of heart and far from vitals mine; ✿ Then let the slanderer wot this truth and see I am sincere.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class="c000">Quoth I, “By Allah, O my lady, when he shall read these verses,
his soul will depart his body!” Quoth she, “O Ibn Mansur, is
passion indeed come to such a pass with him that thou sayest this
saying?” Quoth I, “Had I said more than this verily it were but
the truth: but mercy is of the nature of the noble.” Now when
she heard this her eyes brimmed over with tears and she wrote
him a note, I swear by Allah, O Commander of the Faithful,
there is none in thy Chancery could write the like of it; and
therein were these couplets:—</p>

<div class="lg-container-b c003">
  <div class="linegroup">
    <div class="group">
      <div class="line">How long shall I thy coyness and thy great aversion see? ✿ Thou hast satisfied my censurers and pleased their enmity:</div>

      <div class="line">I wish to welcome thee, dear love, even as welcome I ✿ Sleep to these eyes and eyelids in the place of sleep to be.</div>
      <div class="line">And since ‘tis thou hast made me drain th’ unmixèd cup of love, ✿ If me thou see with wine bemused heap not thy blame on me!</div>

  </div>

<p class="c000">And when she had written the missive,——And Shahrazad perceived

had written the missive, she sealed it and gave it to me; and I
said, “O my lady, in good sooth this thy letter will make the sick
man whole and ease the thirsting soul.” Then I took it and went
from her, when she called me back and said to me, “O son of
Mansur, say to him:—She will be thy guest this night.” At this
I joyed with exceeding great joy and carried the letter to Jubayr,
whom I found with his eyes fixed intently on the door, expecting
the reply and as soon as I gave him the letter and he opened and
read it and understood it, he uttered a great cry and fell down in
a fainting fit. When he came to himself, he said to me, “O Ibn
Mansur, did she indeed write this note with her hand and feel it
with her fingers?” Answered I, “O my lord, do folk write with
their feet?” And by Allah, O Commander of the Faithful, I had
not done speaking these words, when we heard the tinkle-tinkle of
her anklets in the vestibule and she entered. And seeing her he
sprang to his feet as though nothing pained or ailed him and
embraced her like the letter L embraceth the letter A;<a id="r344"></a><a href="#f344" class="c014"><sup>[344]</sup></a> and the
infirmity, that erst would not depart at once left him.<a id="r345"></a><a href="#f345" class="c014"><sup>[345]</sup></a> Then he
sat down, but she abode standing and I said to her, “O my lady,
why dost thou not sit?” Said she, “O Ibn Mansur, save on a
condition that is between us, I will not sit.” I asked, “And what
is that?”; and she answered, “None may know lovers’ secrets,”
and putting her mouth to Jubayr’s ear whispered to him; whereupon
he replied, “I hear and I obey.” Then he rose and said
somewhat in a whisper to one of his slaves, who went out and
returned in a little while with a Kazi and two witnesses. Thereupon
Jubayr stood up and taking a bag containing an hundred
thousand dinars, said, “O Kazi, marry me to this young lady
and write this sum to her marriage-settlement.” Quoth the Kazi
<span class="pageno" id="Page_244">244</span>to her, “Say thou, I consent to this.” “I consent to this,” quoth
she, whereupon he drew up the contract of marriage and she
opened the bag; and, taking out a handful of gold, gave it to
the Kazi and the witnesses and handed the rest to Jubayr.
Thereupon the Kazi and the witnesses withdrew, and I sat with
them, in mirth and merriment, till the most part of the night was
past, when I said in my mind, “These are lovers and they have
been this long while separated. I will now arise and go sleep
in some place afar from them and leave them to their privacy,
one with other.” So I rose, but she caught hold of my skirts,
saying, “What thinkest thou to do?” “Nothing but so and so,”
answered I; upon which she rejoined, “Sit thee down; and
when we would be rid of thee, we will send thee away.” So I sat
down with them till near daybreak, when she said to me, “O Ibn
Mansur, go to yonder chamber; for we have furnished it for thee
and it is thy sleeping-place.” Thereupon I arose and went thither
and slept till morning, when a page brought me basin and ewer,
and I made the ablution and prayed the dawn-prayer. Then I sat
down and presently, behold, Jubayr and his beloved came out of
the bath in the house, and I saw them both wringing their locks.<a id="r346"></a><a href="#f346" class="c014"><sup>[346]</sup></a>
So I wished them good morning and gave them joy of their safety
and reunion, saying to Jubayr, “That which began with constraint
and conditions hath ended in cordial contentment.” He answered,
“Thou sayest well, and indeed thou deservest thy honorarium;”
and he called his treasurer, and said, “Bring hither three thousand
dinars.” So he brought a purse containing the gold pieces and
Jubayr gave it to me, saying, “Favour us by accepting this.” But
I replied, “I will not accept it till thou tell me the manner of the
transfer of love from her to thee, after so huge an aversion.”
Quoth he, “Hearkening and obedience! Know that we have a
festival called New Year’s day,<a id="r347"></a><a href="#f347" class="c014"><sup>[347]</sup></a> when all the people fare forth and
<span class="pageno" id="Page_245">245</span>take boat and go a-pleasuring on the river. So I went out with
my comrades, and saw a skiff, wherein were ten damsels like
moons and amongst them, the Lady Budur lute in hand.” She
preluded in eleven modes, then, returning to the first, sang these
two couplets:—</p>

<div class="lg-container-b c003">

<p class="c000">She said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that Jubayr continued,
“So cried I to her:—Repeat the couplets and the air! But
she would not; whereupon I bade the boatmen pelt her with
oranges, and they pelted her till we feared her boat would founder.
Then she went her way, and this is how the love was transferred
from her heart to mine.” So I wished them joy of their union;
and, taking the purse with its contents, I returned to Baghdad.
Now when the Caliph heard Ibn Mansur’s story his heart was
lightened and the restlessness and oppression from which he
suffered forsook him. And they also tell the tale of</p>

  <h2 id="c245" class="c007">THE MAN OF AL-YAMAN AND HIS SIX SLAVE-GIRLS.</h2>
</div>

<p class="c013">The Caliph Al-Maamun was sitting one day in his palace, surrounded
by his Lords of the realm and Officers of state, and there
were present also before him all his poets and cup-companions,
amongst the rest one named Mohammed of Bassorah. Presently
the Caliph turned and said to him, “O Mohammed, I wish thee
forthwith to tell me something that I have never before heard.”
He replied, “O Commander of the Faithful, dost thou wish me to
tell thee a thing I have heard with my ears or a thing I have seen
with my eyes?” Quoth Al-Maamun, “Tell me whichever is the
rarer;” so Mohammed Al-Basri began:—Know, then, O Commander
of the Faithful, that there lived once upon a time a
<span class="pageno" id="Page_246">246</span>wealthy man, who was a native of Al-Yaman; but he emigrated
from his native land and came to this city of Baghdad, whose
sojourn so pleased him that he transported hither his family and
possessions. Now he had six slave-girls, like moons one and all;
the first white, the second brown, the third fat, the fourth lean, the
fifth yellow and the sixth lamp-black; and all six were comely of
countenance and perfect in accomplishments and skilled in the
arts of singing and playing upon musical instruments. Now it so
chanced that, one day, he sent for the girls and called for meat and
wine; and they ate and drank and were mirthful and made merry.
Then he filled the cup and, taking it in his hand, said to the blonde
girl, “O new-moon face, let us hear somewhat of thy pleasant
songs.” So she took the lute and tuning it, made music thereon
with such sweet melody that the place danced with glee; after
which she played a lively measure and sang these couplets:—</p>

<div class="lg-container-b c003">
  <div class="linegroup">
    <div class="group">
      <div class="line">I have a friend, whose form is fixed within mine eyes,<a id="r348"></a><a href="#f348" class="c014"><sup>[348]</sup></a> ✿ Whose name deep buried in my very vitals lies:</div>
      <div class="line">Whenas remembers him my mind all heart am I, ✿ And when on him my gaze is turned I am all eyes.</div>
      <div class="line">My censor saith, “Forswear, forget, the love of him,” ✿ “Whatso is not to be, how shall’t be?” My reply is.</div>
      <div class="line">Quoth I, “O Censor mine, go forth from me, avaunt! ✿ And make not light of that on humans heavy lies.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class="c000">Hereat their master rejoiced and, drinking off his cup, gave the
damsels to drink, after which he said to the berry-brown girl, “O
brasier-light<a id="r349"></a><a href="#f349" class="c014"><sup>[349]</sup></a> and joy of the sprite, let us hear thy lovely voice,
whereby all that hearken are ravished with delight.” So she took
the lute and thereon made harmony till the place was moved to
glee; then, captivating all hearts with her graceful swaying, she
sang these couplets:—</p>

<div class="lg-container-b c003">
  <div class="linegroup">
    <div class="group">
      <div class="line">I swear by that fair face’s life, I’ll love but thee ✿ Till death us part; nor other love but thine I’ll see;</div>
      <div class="line">O full moon, with thy loveliness mantilla’d o’er, ✿ The loveliest of our earth beneath thy banner be:</div>
      <div class="line">Thou, who surpassest all the fair in pleasantness ✿ May Allah, Lord of worlds, be everywhere with thee!</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class="c000"><span class="pageno" id="Page_247">247</span>The master rejoiced and drank off his cup and gave the girls to
drink; after which he filled again; and, taking the goblet in his
hand, signed to the fat girl and bade her sing and play a different
motive. So she took the lute and striking a grief-dispelling
measure, sang these couplets:—</p>

<div class="lg-container-b c003">
  <div class="linegroup">
    <div class="group">
      <div class="line">An thou but deign consent, O wish to heart affied! ✿ I care not wrath and rage to all mankind betide.</div>
      <div class="line">And if thou show that fairest face which gives me life, ✿ I reck not an diminished heads the Kings go hide.</div>
      <div class="line">I seek thy favours only from this ‘versal world: ✿ O thou in whom all beauty doth firm-fixt abide!</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class="c000">The man rejoiced and, emptying his cup, gave the girls to drink.
Then he signed to the thin girl and said to her, “O Houri of
Paradise, feed thou our ears with sweet words and sounds.” So
she took the lute; and, tuning it, preluded and sang these two
couplets:—</p>

<div class="lg-container-b c003">
  <div class="linegroup">
    <div class="group">
      <div class="line">Say me, on Allah’s path<a id="r350"></a><a href="#f350" class="c014"><sup>[350]</sup></a> hast death not dealt to me, ✿ Turning from me while I to thee turn patiently:</div>
      <div class="line">Say me, is there no judge of Love to judge us twain, ✿ And do me justice wronged, mine enemy, by thee?</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class="c000">Their lord rejoiced and, emptying the cup, gave the girls to
drink. Then filling another he signed to the yellow girl and said
to her, “O sun of the day, let us hear some nice verses.” So she
took the lute and, preluding after the goodliest fashion, sang these
couplets:—</p>

<div class="lg-container-b c003">
  <div class="linegroup">
    <div class="group">
      <div class="line">I have a lover and when drawing him, ✿ He draws on me a sword-blade glancing grim:</div>

      <div class="line">He is my wish and will of all men, but ✿ Fate’s envious hand to me’s aye grudging him.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class="c000">The master rejoiced and drank and gave the girls to drink; then
he filled the cup and taking it in hand, signed to the black girl,
saying, “O pupil of the eye, let us have a taste of thy quality,
<span class="pageno" id="Page_248">248</span>though it be but two words.” So she took the lute and tuning
it and tightening the strings, preluded in various modes, then
returned to the first and sang to a lively air these couplets:—</p>

<div class="lg-container-b c003">
  <div class="linegroup">
    <div class="group">
      <div class="line">Ho ye, mine eyes, let prodigal tears go free; ✿ This ecstasy would see my being unbe:<a id="r351"></a><a href="#f351" class="c014"><sup>[351]</sup></a></div>

      <div class="line">Cups of pure wine, time was, went circuiting ✿ In joy, what time the lute sang melody,</div>
      <div class="line">While kept his troth the friend who madded me, ✿ Yet made me rising star of bliss to see:</div>
      <div class="line">But—with Time, turned he not by sin of mine; ✿ Than such a turn can aught more bitter be?</div>

    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class="c000">Thereupon rose the six girls and, kissing the ground before their
lord, said to him, “Do thou justice between us, O our lord!” So
he looked at their beauty and loveliness and the contrast of their
colours and praised Almighty Allah and glorified Him. Then
said he, “There is none of you but hath learnt the Koran by
heart, and mastered the musical art and is versed in the chronicles
of yore and the doings of peoples which have gone before; so it
is my desire that each one of you rise and, pointing finger at her
opposite, praise herself and dispraise her co-concubine; that is to
say, let the blonde point to the brunette, the plump to the slender
and the yellow to the black girl; after which the rivals, each in her
turn, shall do the like with the former; and be this illustrated
with citations from Holy Writ and somewhat of anecdotes and
verse, so as to show forth your fine breeding and elegance of your
pleading.” And they answered him, “We hear and we obey!”——And
Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say
her permitted say.</p>

handmaids answered the man of Al-Yaman, “We hear and we

black girl, said to her:—Out on thee, blackamoor! It is told by
tradition that whiteness saith:—I am the shining light, I am the

shall come forth white, without hurt.<a id="r357"></a><a href="#f357" class="c014"><sup>[357]</sup></a> And again He saith:—But
they whose faces shall become white, shall be in the mercy of
Allah; therein shall they remain for ever.<a id="r358"></a><a href="#f358" class="c014"><sup>[358]</sup></a> My colour is a sign, a
miracle, and my loveliness supreme and my beauty a term extreme.
It is on the like of me that raiment showeth fair and fine
and to the like of me that hearts incline. Moreover, in whiteness
are many excellences; for instance, the snow falleth white from
<span class="pageno" id="Page_250">250</span>heaven, and it is traditional that the beautifullest of colours is
white. The Moslems also glory in white turbands; but I should
be tedious, were I to tell all that may be told in praise of white;
little and enough is better than too much of unfilling stuff. So
now I will begin with thy dispraise, O black, O colour of ink and
blacksmith’s dust, thou whose face is like the raven which bringeth
about the parting of lovers. Verily, the poet saith in praise of
white and blame of black:—</p>

<div class="lg-container-b c003">
  <div class="linegroup">
    <div class="group">
      <div class="line">Seest not that pearls are prized for milky hue, ✿ But with a dirham buy we coals in load?</div>
      <div class="line">And while white faces enter Paradise, ✿ Black faces crowd Gehenna’s black abode.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class="c000">And indeed it is told in certain histories, related on the authority
of devout men, that Noah (on whom be peace!) was sleeping one
day, with his sons Cham and Shem seated at his head, when a wind
sprang up and, lifting his clothes, uncovered his nakedness; whereat
Cham looked and laughed and did not cover him: but Shem arose
and covered him. Presently, their sire awoke and learning, what
had been done by his sons, blessed Shem and cursed Cham. So
Shem’s face was whitened and from him sprang the prophets and the
orthodox Caliphs and Kings; whilst Cham’s face was blackened and
he fled forth to the land of Abyssinia, and of his lineage came the
blacks.<a id="r359"></a><a href="#f359" class="c014"><sup>[359]</sup></a> All people are of one mind in affirming the lack of understanding
of the blacks, even as saith the adage, “How shall one
find a black with a mind?” Quoth her master, “Sit thee down,
thou hast given us sufficient and even excess.” Thereupon he
signed to the negress, who rose and, pointing her finger at the
blonde, said:—Dost thou not know that in the Koran sent down
to His prophet and apostle, is transmitted the saying of God the
Most High, “By the night when it covereth all things with darkness;
by the day when it shineth forth!”<a id="r360"></a><a href="#f360" class="c014"><sup>[360]</sup></a> If the night were not
the more illustrious, verily Allah had not sworn by it nor had given
it precedence of the day. And indeed all men of wit and wisdom
accept this. Knowest thou not that black is the ornament of
<span class="pageno" id="Page_251">251</span>youth and that, when hoariness descendeth upon the head, delights
pass away and the hour of death draweth in sight? Were not
black the most illustrious of things, Allah had not set it in the
core of the heart<a id="r361"></a><a href="#f361" class="c014"><sup>[361]</sup></a> and the pupil of the eye; and how excellent is
the saying of the poet:—</p>

<div class="lg-container-b c003">
  <div class="linegroup">
    <div class="group">
      <div class="line">I love not black girls but because they show ✿ Youth’s colour, tinct of eye and heart-core’s hue;</div>
      <div class="line">Nor are in error who unlove the white, ✿ And hoary hairs and winding-sheet eschew.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class="c000">And that said of another:—</p>

<div class="lg-container-b c003">
  <div class="linegroup">
    <div class="group">
      <div class="line">Black<a id="r362"></a><a href="#f362" class="c014"><sup>[362]</sup></a> girls, not white, are they ✿ All worthy love I see:</div>

  </div>
</div>

<p class="c000">Moreover, is the foregathering of lovers good but in the night?
Let this quality and profit suffice thee. What protecteth lovers
from spies and censors like the blackness of night’s darkness; and
what causeth to them to fear discovery like the whiteness of the
<span class="pageno" id="Page_252">252</span>dawn’s brightness? So, how many claims to honour are there not
in blackness and how excellent is the saying of the poet!—</p>

    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class="c000">And a fifth:—</p>

<div class="lg-container-b c003">
  <div class="linegroup">
    <div class="group">
      <div class="line">I love not white girls blown with fat who puff and pant; ✿ The maid for me is young brunette embonpoint-scant.</div>

  <div class="linegroup">

      <div class="line">My lover came to me one night, ✿ And clipt we both with fond embrace;</div>

      <div class="line">And make night last me long as he ✿ Lies in the arms that tightly lace.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class="c000">Were I to set forth all the praises of blackness, my tale would be
tedious; but little and enough is better than too much of unfilling
<span class="pageno" id="Page_253">253</span>stuff. As for thee, O blonde, thy colour is that of leprosy and
thine embrace is suffocation,<a id="r367"></a><a href="#f367" class="c014"><sup>[367]</sup></a> and it is of report that hoar-frost
and icy cold<a id="r368"></a><a href="#f368" class="c014"><sup>[368]</sup></a> are in Gehenna for the torment of the wicked.
Again, of things black and excellent is ink, wherewith is written
Allah’s word; and were it not for black ambergris and black
musk, there would be no perfumes to carry to Kings. How many
glories I may not mention dwell in blackness, and how well saith
the poet:—</p>

<div class="lg-container-b c003">
  <div class="linegroup">
    <div class="group">
      <div class="line">Seest not that musk, the nut-brown musk, e’er 
claims the highest price, ✿ Whilst for a load of whitest lime none more 
than dirham bids?</div>
      <div class="line">And while white speck upon the eye deforms the 
loveliest youth, ✿ Black eyes discharge the sharpest shafts in lashes 
from their lids.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class="c000">Quoth her master, “Sit thee down: this much sufficeth.” So
she sat down and he signed to the fat girl, who rose——And
Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted
say.</p>

<div>

<div class="nf-center-c1">
<div class="nf-center c005">
    <div>Now when it was the Three Hundred and Thirty-sixth Night,</div>
  </div>
</div>

</div>

<p class="c000">She said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that the man
of Al-Yaman, the master of the handmaids, signed to the fat girl
who rose and, pointing her finger at the slim girl, bared her calves
and wrists and uncovered her stomach, showing its dimples and
the plump rondure of her navel. Then she donned a shift of fine
stuff, that exposed her whole body, and said:—Praised be Allah
who created me, for that He beautified my face and made me fat
and fair of the fattest and fairest; and likened me to branches
laden with fruit, and bestowed upon me abounding beauty and
brightness: and praised be He no less, for that He hath given me
the precedence and honoured me, when He mentioneth me in His
holy Book! Quoth the Most High, “And he brought a fatted
<span class="pageno" id="Page_254">254</span>calf.”<a id="r369"></a><a href="#f369" class="c014"><sup>[369]</sup></a> And He hath made me like unto a vergier full of peaches
and pomegranates. In very sooth even as the townsfolk long for
fat birds and eat of them and love not lean birds, so do the sons
of Adam desire fat meat and eat of it. How many vauntful
attributes are there not in fatness, and how well saith the poet:—</p>

<div class="lg-container-b c003">
  <div class="linegroup">
    <div class="group">
      <div class="line">Farewell thy love, for see, the Cafilah’s<a id="r370"></a><a href="#f370" class="c014"><sup>[370]</sup></a> on the move: ✿ O man, canst bear to say adieu and leave thy love?</div>
      <div class="line">‘Tis as her going were to seek her neighbour’s tent, ✿ The gait of fat fair maid, whom hearts shall all approve.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class="c000">Sawest thou ever one stand before a flesher’s stall but sought of
him fat flesh? The wise say, “Joyance is in three things, eating
meat and riding meat and putting meat into meat.”<a id="r371"></a><a href="#f371" class="c014"><sup>[371]</sup></a> As for thee,
O thin one, thy calves are like the shanks of sparrows or the
pokers of furnaces; and thou art a cruciform plank or a piece of
flesh poor and rank; there is naught in thee to gladden the heart;
even as saith the poet:—</p>

<div class="lg-container-b c003">
  <div class="linegroup">
    <div class="group">
      <div class="line">With Allah take I refuge from whatever driveth me ✿ To bed with one like footrasp<a id="r372"></a><a href="#f372" class="c014"><sup>[372]</sup></a> or the roughest ropery:</div>
      <div class="line">In every limb she hath a horn that butteth me whene’er ✿ I fain would rest, so morn and eve I wend me wearily.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class="c000">Quoth her master, “Sit thee down: this much sufficeth.” So
she sat down and he signed to the slender girl, who rose, as she
were a willow-wand, or a rattan-frond or a stalk of sweet basil,
and said:—Praised be Allah who created me and beautified me
and made my embraces the end of all desire and likened me to the
branch, whereto all hearts incline. If I rise, I rise lightly; if I
sit, I sit prettily; I am nimble-witted at a jest and merrier-souled
than mirth itself. Never heard I one describe his mistress,
saying, “My beloved is the bigness of an elephant or like a
<span class="pageno" id="Page_255">255</span>mountain long and broad;” but rather, “My lady hath a slender
waist and a slim shape.”<a id="r373"></a><a href="#f373" class="c014"><sup>[373]</sup></a> Furthermore a little food filleth me and
a little water quencheth my thirst; my sport is agile and my
habit active; for I am sprightlier than the sparrow and lighter-skipping
than the starling. My favours are the longing of the
lover and the delight of the desirer; for I am goodly of shape,
sweet of smile and graceful as the bending willow-wand or the
rattan-cane<a id="r374"></a><a href="#f374" class="c014"><sup>[374]</sup></a> or the stalk of the basil-plant; nor is there any can
compare with me in loveliness, even as saith one of me:—</p>

<div class="lg-container-b c003">
  <div class="linegroup">
    <div class="group">
      <div class="line">Thy shape with willow branch I dare compare, ✿ And hold thy figure as my fortunes fair:</div>
      <div class="line">I wake each morn distraught, and follow thee, ✿ And from the rival’s eye in fear I fare.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class="c000">It is for the like of me that amourists run mad and that those
who desire me wax distracted. If my lover would draw me to
him, I am drawn to him; and if he would have me incline to
him, I incline to him and not against him. But now, as for thee,
O fat of body, thine eating is the feeding of an elephant, and
neither much nor little filleth thee. When thou liest with a man
who is lean, he hath no ease of thee; nor can he anyways take his
pleasure of thee; for the bigness of thy belly holdeth him off from
going in unto thee and the fatness of thy thighs hindereth him
from coming at thy slit. What goodness is there in thy grossness,
and what courtesy or pleasantness in thy coarseness? Fat flesh is
fit for naught but the flesher, nor is there one point therein that
pleadeth for praise. If one joke with thee, thou art angry; if
one sport with thee, thou art sulky; if thou sleep, thou snorest;
if thou walk, thou lollest out thy tongue! if thou eat, thou art
never filled. Thou art heavier than mountains and fouler than
corruption and crime. Thou hast in thee nor agility nor benedicite
nor thinkest thou of aught save meat and sleep. When
thou pissest thou swishest; if thou turd thou gruntest like a
bursten wine-skin or an elephant transmogrified. If thou go to
the water-closet, thou needest one to wash thy gap and pluck out
<span class="pageno" id="Page_256">256</span>the hairs which overgrow it; and this is the extreme of sluggishness
and the sign, outward and visible, of stupidity.<a id="r375"></a><a href="#f375" class="c014"><sup>[375]</sup></a> In short,
there is no good thing about thee, and indeed the poet saith of
thee:—</p>

<div class="lg-container-b c003">
  <div class="linegroup">
    <div class="group">
      <div class="line">Heavy and swollen like an urine-bladder blown, ✿ With hips and thighs like mountain propping piles of stone;</div>
      <div class="line">Whene’er she walks in Western hemisphere, her tread ✿ Makes the far Eastern world with weight to moan and groan.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class="c000">Quoth her master, “Sit thee down, this sufficeth;” so she sat down
and he signed to the yellow girl, who rose to her feet and praised
Allah Almighty and magnified His name, calling down peace and
blessing on Mohammed the best of His creatures; after which she
pointed her finger at the brunette and said to her,——And Shahrazad
perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted
say.</p>

<div>

<div class="nf-center-c1">
<div class="nf-center c005">
    <div>Now when it was the Three Hundred and Thirty-seventh Night,</div>
  </div>
</div>

</div>

<p class="c000">She continued, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that the
yellow girl stood up and praised Almighty Allah and magnified
His name; after which she pointed her finger at the brown girl
and said to her:—I am the one praised in the Koran, and the
Compassionate hath described my complexion and its excellence
over all other hues in His manifest Book, where Allah saith, “A
yellow, pure yellow, whose colour gladdeneth the beholders.”<a id="r376"></a><a href="#f376" class="c014"><sup>[376]</sup></a>
Wherefore my colour is a sign and portent and my grace is
supreme and my beauty a term extreme; for that my tint is the
<span class="pageno" id="Page_257">257</span>tint of a ducat and the colour of the planets and moons and the
hue of ripe apples. My fashion is the fashion of the fair, and the
dye of saffron outvieth all other dyes; so my semblance is wondrous
and my colour marvellous. I am soft of body and of high
price, comprising all qualities of beauty. My colour is essentially
precious as virgin gold, and how many boasts and glories doth it
not unfold! Of the like of me quoth the poet:—</p>

<div class="lg-container-b c003">
  <div class="linegroup">
    <div class="group">
      <div class="line">Her golden yellow is the sheeny sun’s; ✿ And like gold sequins she delights the sight:</div>
      <div class="line">Saffron small portion of her glance can show; ✿ Nay,<a id="r377"></a><a href="#f377" class="c014"><sup>[377]</sup></a> she outvies the moon when brightest bright.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class="c000">And I shall at once begin in thy dispraise, O berry-brown girl!
Thy tincture is that of the buffalo, and all souls shudder at thy
sight. If thy colour be in any created thing, it is blamed; if it be
in food, it is poisoned; for thy hue is the hue of the dung-fly; it
is a mark of ugliness even in dogs; and among the colours it is one
which strikes with amazement and is of the signs of mourning.
Never heard I of brown gold or brown pearls or brown gems. If
thou enter the privy, thy colour changeth, and when thou comest
out, thou addest ugliness to ugliness. Thou art a non-descript;
neither black, that thou mayst be recognised, nor white, that thou
mayst be described; and in thee there is no good quality, even as
saith the poet:—</p>

<div class="lg-container-b c003">
  <div class="linegroup">
    <div class="group">
      <div class="line">The hue of dusty motes is hers; that dull brown hue of hers ✿ Is mouldy, like the dust and mud by Cossid’s foot upthrown:<a id="r378"></a><a href="#f378" class="c014"><sup>[378]</sup></a></div>
      <div class="line">I never look upon her brow, e’en for eye-twinkling’s space, ✿ But in brown study fall I and my thoughts take browner tone.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class="c000">Quoth her master, “Sit thee down; this much sufficeth;” so she
sat down and he signed to the brunette. Now she was a model of
beauty and loveliness and symmetry and perfect grace; soft of
skin, slim of shape, of stature rare, and coal-black hair; with
cheeks rosy-pink, eyes black-rimmed by nature’s hand, face fair,
and eloquent tongue; moreover slender-waisted and heavy-hipped.
So she rose and said:—Praise be to Allah who hath created me
<span class="pageno" id="Page_258">258</span>neither leper-white nor bile-yellow nor charcoal-black, but hath
made my colour to be beloved of men of wit and wisdom; for all
the poets extol berry-brown maids in every tongue and exalt their
colour over all other colours. To “brown of hue (they say) praise
is due;” and Allah bless him who singeth:—</p>

<p class="c000">She said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that when the
yellow girl ended her recitation, quoth her master, “Sit thee down;
this much sufficeth!” Then he made peace between them and
clad them all in sumptuous robes of honour and hanselled them
with precious jewels of land and sea. And never have I seen, O
Commander of the Faithful, any when or any where, aught fairer
than these six damsels fair. Now when Al-Maamun heard this
story from Mohammed of Bassorah, he turned to him and said,
<span class="pageno" id="Page_260">260</span>“O Mohammed, knowest thou the abiding-place of these damsels
and their master, and canst thou contrive to buy them of him for
us?” He answered, “O Commander of the Faithful, indeed I
have heard that their lord is wrapped up in them and cannot bear
to be parted from them.” Rejoined the Caliph, “Take thee ten
thousand gold pieces for each girl, that is sixty thousand for the
whole purchase; and carry the coin to his house and buy them of
him.” So Mohammed of Bassorah took the money and, betaking
himself to the Man of Al-Yaman, acquainted him with the wish
of the Prince of True Believers. He consented to part with them
at that price to pleasure the Caliph; and despatched them to Al-Maamun,
who assigned them an elegant abode and therein used
to sit with them as cup-companions; marvelling at their beauty
and loveliness, at their varied colours and at the excellence of
their conversation. Thus matters stood for many a day; but,
after awhile, when their former owner could no longer bear to
be parted from them, he sent a letter to the Commander of the
Faithful complaining to him of his own ardent love-longing for
them and containing, amongst other contents, these couplets:—</p>

lifting her robe (Koran xxvii.), Solomon was minded to marry her, but would not do so
till the devils had by a depilatory removed the hair. The popular preparation (called
Núrah) consists of quicklime 7 parts, and Zirník or orpiment, 3 parts: it is applied in
the Hammam to a perspiring skin, and it must be washed off immediately the hair is
loosened or it burns and discolours. The rest of the body-pile (Sha’arat opp. to Sha’ar
= hair) is eradicated by applying a mixture of boiled honey with turpentine or other
gum, and rolling it with the hand till the hair comes off. Men I have said remove the
pubes by shaving, and pluck the hair of the armpits, one of the vestages of pre-Adamite
man. A good depilatory is still a desideratum, the best perfumers of London and Paris
have none which they can recommend. The reason is plain: the hair-bulb can be
eradicated only by destroying the skin.</p>

  <h2 id="c261" class="c007">HARUN AL-RASHID AND THE DAMSEL AND ABU NOWAS.</h2>
</div>

<p class="c013">The Caliph, Commander of the Faithful, Harun al-Rashid, being
one night exceedingly restless and thoughtful with sad thought,
rose from his couch and walked about the by-ways of his palace,
till he came to a chamber, over whose doorway hung a curtain.
He raised that curtain and saw, at the upper end of the room,
a bedstead whereon lay something black, as it were a man asleep,
with a wax taper on his right hand and another on his left; and
as the Caliph stood wondering at the sight, behold, he remarked
a flagon full of old wine whose mouth was covered by the cup.
The Caliph wondered even more at this, saying, “How came this
black by such wine-service?” Then, drawing near the bedstead,
he found that it was a girl lying asleep there, curtained by her
hair; so he uncovered her face and saw that it was like the moon,
on the night of his fulness.<a id="r387"></a><a href="#f387" class="c014"><sup>[387]</sup></a> So the Caliph filled himself a cup of
wine and drank it to the roses of her cheeks; and, feeling inclined
to enjoy her, kissed a mole on her face, whereupon she started up
from sleep, and cried out, “O Trusted of Allah,<a id="r388"></a><a href="#f388" class="c014"><sup>[388]</sup></a> what may this
be?” Replied he, “A guest who knocketh at thy door, hoping that
thou wilt give him hospitality till the dawn;” and she answered;
“Even so! I will serve him with my hearing and my sight.” So
she brought forward the wine and they drank together, after which
she took the lute and tuning the strings, preluded in one-and-twenty
modes, then returning to the first, played a lively measure
and sang these couplets:—</p>

<div class="lg-container-b c003">
  <div class="linegroup">
    <div class="group">
      <div class="line">The tongue of love from heart bespeaks my sprite, ✿ Telling I love thee with love infinite:</div>

      <div class="line">I cannot hide the love that harms my life; ✿ Tears ever roll and growth of pine I sight:</div>
      <div class="line">I knew not what love was ere loving thee; ✿ But Allah’s destiny to all is dight.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class="c000">And when her verses were ended she said, “O Commander of the
Faithful, I have been wronged!”——And Shahrazad perceived the
dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say.</p>

<div>

<div class="nf-center-c1">
<div class="nf-center c005">
    <div>Now when it was the Three Hundred and Thirty-ninth Night,</div>
  </div>
</div>

</div>

<p class="c000">She said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that the damsel
cried, “O Commander of the Faithful, I have been wronged!”
Quoth he, “How so, and who hath wronged thee?” Quoth she
“Thy son bought me awhile ago, for ten thousand dirhams,
meaning to give me to thee; but thy wife, the daughter of thine
uncle, sent him the said price and bade him shut me up from thee
in this chamber.” Whereupon said the Caliph. “Ask a boon of
me,” and she, “I ask thee to lie with me to-morrow night.”
Replied the Caliph, “Inshallah!” and leaving her, went away.
Now as soon as it was morning, he repaired to his sitting-room and
called for Abu Nowás, but found him not and sent his chamberlain
to ask after him. The chamberlain found him in a tavern, pawned
and pledged for a score of a thousand dirhams, which he had spent
on a certain beardless youth, and questioned him of his case. So
he told him what had betided him with the comely boy and how
he had spent upon him a thousand silver pieces; whereupon quoth
the chamberlain, “Show him to me; and if he be worth this, thou
art excused.” He answered, “Patience, and thou shalt see him
presently.” As they were talking together, up came the lad, clad
in a white tunic, under which was another of red and under this
yet another black. Now when Abu Nowas saw him, he sighed a
loud sigh and improvised these couplets:—</p>

<div class="lg-container-b c003">
  <div class="linegroup">
    <div class="group">
      <div class="line">He showed himself in shirt of white, ✿ With eyes and eyelids languor-dight.</div>
      <div class="line">Quoth I, “Dost pass and greet me not? ✿ Though were thy greeting a delight?</div>
      <div class="line">Blest He who clothed in rose thy cheeks, ✿ Creates what wills He by His might!”</div>
      <div class="line">Quoth he, “Leave prate, forsure my Lord ✿ Of works is wondrous infinite:</div>
      <div class="line">My garment’s like my face and luck; ✿ All three are white on white on white.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class="c000"><span class="pageno" id="Page_263">263</span>When the beardless one heard these words, he doffed the white
tunic and appeared in the red; and when Abu Nowas saw him
he redoubled in expressions of admiration and repeated these
couplets:—</p>

<div class="lg-container-b c003">
  <div class="linegroup">
    <div class="group">
      <div class="line">He showed in garb anemone-red, ✿ A foeman “friend” entitulèd:</div>
      <div class="line">Quoth I in marvel, “Thou’rt full moon ✿ Whose weed shames rose however red:</div>
      <div class="line">Hath thy cheek stained it red, or hast ✿ Dyed it in blood by lovers bled?”</div>
      <div class="line">Quoth he, “Sol gave me this for shirt ✿ When hasting down the West to bed:</div>
      <div class="line">So garb and wine and hue of cheek ✿ All three are red on red on red.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class="c000">And when the verses came to an end, the beardless one doffed the
red tunic and stood in the black; and, when Abu Nowas saw him,
he redoubled in attention to him and versified in these couplets:—</p>

<div class="lg-container-b c003">
  <div class="linegroup">
    <div class="group">
      <div class="line">He came in sable-huèd sacque ✿ And shone in dark men’s heart to rack:</div>
      <div class="line">Quoth I, “Dost pass and greet me not? ✿ Joying the hateful envious pack?</div>
      <div class="line">Thy garment’s like thy locks and like ✿ My lot, three blacks on black on black.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class="c000">Seeing this state of things and understanding the case of Abu
Nowas and his love-longing, the Chamberlain returned to the
Caliph and acquainted him therewith; so he bade him pouch a
thousand dirhams and go and take him out of pawn. Thereupon
the Chamberlain returned to Abu Nowas and, paying his score,
carried him to the Caliph, who said, “Make me some verses containing
the words, O Trusted of Allah, what may this be?”
Answered he, “I hear and I obey, O Commander of the Faithful.”——And
Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying
her permitted say.</p>

been present with us.”<a id="r389"></a><a href="#f389" class="c014"><sup>[389]</sup></a> Then he took him by the hand and
carried him to the damsel and, when Abu Nowas saw her clad
in a dress and veil of blue, he expressed abundant admiration
and improvised these couplets:—</p>

<div class="lg-container-b c003">
  <div class="linegroup">
    <div class="group">
      <div class="line">Say to the pretty one in veil of blue, ✿ “By Allah, O my life, have ruth on dole!</div>

      <div class="line">By charms of thee and whitest cheek I swear thee, ✿ Pity a heart for love lost all control:</div>
      <div class="line">Bend to him, be his stay ‘gainst stress of love, ✿ Nor aught accept what saith the ribald fool.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class="c000">Now when he ended his verse, the damsel set wine before the
Caliph; and, taking the lute, played a lively measure and sang these
couplets:—</p>

<div class="lg-container-b c003">
  <div class="linegroup">
    <div class="group">
      <div class="line">Wilt thou be just to others in thy love, and do ✿ Unright, and put me off, and take new friend in lieu?</div>

      <div class="line">If thou forbid me pass your door, yet I afar ✿ Will stand, and viewing you waft my salams to you!</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class="c000"><span class="pageno" id="Page_265">265</span>The Caliph bade her ply Abu Nowas with wine, till he lost his
right senses; thereupon he gave him a full cup, and he drank a
draught of it and held the cup in his hand till he slept. Then the
Commander of the Faithful bade the girl take the cup from his
grasp and hide it; so she took it and set it between her thighs;
moreover he drew his scymitar and, standing at the head of Abu
Nowas, pricked him with the point; whereupon he awoke and saw
the drawn sword and the Caliph standing over him. At this sight
the fumes of the wine fled from his head and the Caliph said to
him, “Make me some verses and tell me therein what is become
of thy cup; or I will cut off thy head.” So he improvised these
couplets:—</p>

<div class="lg-container-b c003">
  <div class="linegroup">
    <div class="group">

      <div class="line">I name it not, for dread of him ✿ Who hath of it command-in-chief.</div>

</div>

<p class="c000">Quoth the Caliph, “Allah strike thee dead!<a id="r390"></a><a href="#f390" class="c014"><sup>[390]</sup></a> How knewest thou

tribes to make him their umpire concerning the distinction of placing in position the

</div>

<p class="c013">Some time erst there was a man, who had accumulated debts, and
his case was straitened upon him, so that he left his people and
family and went forth in distraction; and he ceased not wandering
on at random till he came after a time to a city tall of walls and firm
of foundations. He entered it in a state of despondency and despair,
harried by hunger and worn with the weariness of his way. As he
passed through one of the main streets, he saw a company of the
great going along; so he followed them till they reached a house
like to a royal palace. He entered with them, and they stayed
not faring forwards till they came in presence of a person seated
at the upper end of a saloon, a man of the most dignified and
majestic aspect, surrounded by pages and eunuchs, as he were of
<span class="pageno" id="Page_266">266</span>the sons of the Wazirs. When he saw the visitors, he rose to greet
them and received them with honour; but the poor man aforesaid
was confounded at his own boldness, when beholding——And
Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted

<div>

<div class="nf-center-c1">
<div class="nf-center c005">
    <div>Now when it was the Three Hundred and Forty-first Night,</div>
  </div>
</div>

</div>

<p class="c000">She said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that the poor
man aforesaid was confounded at his own boldness, when beholding
the goodliness of the place and the crowd of servants and
attendants; so drawing back, in perplexity and fear for his life sat
down apart in a place afar off, where none should see him. Now
it chanced that whilst he was sitting, behold, in came a man with
four sporting-dogs, whereon were various kinds of raw silk and
brocade<a id="r391"></a><a href="#f391" class="c014"><sup>[391]</sup></a> and wearing round their necks collars of gold with chains
of silver, and tied up each dog in a place set privy for him; after
which he went out and presently returned with four dishes of gold,
full of rich meats, which he set severally before the dogs, one for
each. Then he went away and left them, whilst the poor man
began to eye the food, for stress of hunger, and longed to go up to
one of the dogs and eat with him; but fear of them withheld him.
Presently, one of the dogs looked at him and Allah Almighty inspired
the dog with a knowledge of his case; so he drew back from
the platter and signed to the man, who came and ate till he was
filled. Then he would have withdrawn, but the dog again signed
to him to take for himself the dish and what food was left in it,
and pushed it towards him with his fore-paw. So the man took
the dish and leaving the house, went his way, and none followed
him. Then he journeyed to another city where he sold the dish
and buying with the price a stock-in-trade, returned to his own
town. There he sold his goods and paid his debts; and he throve
and became affluent and rose to perfect prosperity. He abode in
his own land; but after some years had passed he said to himself,
“Needs must I repair to the city of the owner of the dish, and'
carry him a fit and handsome present and pay him the money-value
of that which his dog bestowed upon me.” So he took the
price of the dish and a suitable gift; and, setting out, journeyed
<span class="pageno" id="Page_267">267</span>day and night, till he came to that city; he entered it and sought
the place where the man lived; but he found there naught save
ruins mouldering in row and croak of crow, and house and home
desolate and all conditions in changed state. At this, his heart
and soul were troubled, and he repeated the saying of him who
saith:—</p>

<div class="lg-container-b c003">
  <div class="linegroup">
    <div class="group">
      <div class="line">Void are the private rooms of treasury: ✿ As void were hearts of fear and piety:</div>
      <div class="line">Changed is the Wady nor are its gazelles ✿ Those fawns, nor sand-hills those I wont to see.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class="c000">And that of another:—</p>

<div class="lg-container-b c003">
  <div class="linegroup">
    <div class="group">
      <div class="line">In sleep came Su’adá’s<a id="r392"></a><a href="#f392" class="c014"><sup>[392]</sup></a> shade and wakened me ✿ Near dawn, when comrades all a-sleeping lay:</div>
      <div class="line">But waking found I that the shade was fled, ✿ And saw air empty and shrine far away.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class="c000">Now when the man saw these mouldering ruins and witnessed
what the hand of time had manifestly done with the place, leaving
but traces of the substantial things that erewhiles had been, a little
reflection made it needless for him to enquire of the case; so he
turned away. Presently, seeing a wretched man, in a plight which
made him shudder and feel goose-skin, and which would have
moved the very rock to ruth, he said to him, “Ho thou! What
have time and fortune done with the lord of this place? Where
are his lovely faces, his shining full moons and splendid stars; and
what is the cause of the ruin that is come upon his abode, so that
nothing save the walls thereof remain?” Quoth the other, “He
is the miserable thou seest mourning that which hath left him
naked.” But knowest thou not the words of the Apostle (whom
Allah bless and keep!), wherein is a lesson to him who will learn
by it and a warning to whoso will be warned thereby and guided
in the right way, “Verily it is the way of Allah Almighty to raise
up nothing of this world, except He cast it down again?”<a id="r393"></a><a href="#f393" class="c014"><sup>[393]</sup></a> “If
<span class="pageno" id="Page_268">268</span>thou question of the cause of this accident, indeed it is no wonder,
considering the chances and changes of Fortune. I was the lord of
this place and I builded it and founded it and owned it; and I was
the proud possessor of its full moons lucent and its circumstance
resplendent and its damsels radiant and its garniture magnificent,
but Time turned and did away from me wealth and servants
and took from me what it had lent (not given); and brought
upon me calamities which it held in store hidden. But there
must needs be some reason for this thy question: so tell it me and
leave wondering.” Thereupon, the man who had waxed wealthy
being sore concerned, told him the whole story, and added, “I
have brought thee a present, such as souls desire, and the price of
thy dish of gold which I took; for it was the cause of my affluence
after poverty, and of the replenishment of my dwelling-place, after
desolation, and of the dispersion of my trouble and straitness.”
But the man shook his head, and weeping and groaning and complaining
of his lot answered, “Ho thou! methinks thou art mad;
for this is not the way of a man of sense. How should a dog
of mine make generous gift to thee of a dish of gold and I meanly
take back the price of what a dog gave? This were indeed a
strange thing! Were I in extremest unease and misery, by Allah,
I would not accept of thee aught; no, not the worth of a nail-paring!
So return whence thou camest in health and safety.”<a id="r394"></a><a href="#f394" class="c014"><sup>[394]</sup></a>
Whereupon the merchant kissed his feet and taking leave of
him, returned whence he came, praising him and reciting this
couplet:—</p>

</div>

<p class="c013">There was once in the coast-fortress of Alexandria, a Chief of
Police, Husám al-Din hight, the sharp Scymitar of the Faith.
Now one night as he sat in his seat of office, behold, there came
in to him a trooper-wight who said, “Know, O my lord the Chief,
that I entered your city this night and alighted at such a khan
and slept there till a third part of the night was past, when I
awoke and found my saddle-bags sliced open and a purse of a
thousand gold pieces stolen from them.” No sooner had he done
speaking than the Chief summoned his chief officials and bade
them lay hands on all in the khan and clap them in limbo till the
morning; and on the morrow, he caused bring the rods and whips
used in punishment; and, sending for the prisoners, was about to
flog them till they confessed in the presence of the owner of the
stolen money when, lo! a man broke through the crowd till he
came up to the Chief of Police,——And Shahrazad perceived the

was about to flog them when lo! a man broke through the crowd
till he came up to the Chief of Police and the trooper and said,
“Ho! Emir, let these folk go, for they are wrongously accused.
It was I who robbed this trooper, and see, here is the purse I
stole from his saddle-bags.” So saying, he pulled out the purse
from his sleeve and laid it before Husam' al-Din, who said to the
soldier, “Take thy money and pouch it; thou now hast no ground
of complaint against the people of the khan.” Thereupon these
folk and all who were present fell to praising the thief and
blessing him; but he said, “Ho! Emir, the skill is not in that I
came to thee in person and brought thee the purse; the cleverness
was in taking it a second time from this trooper.” Asked the
Chief, “And how didst thou do to take it, O sharper?”; and the
<span class="pageno" id="Page_270">270</span>robber replied, “O Emir, I was standing in the Shroff’s<a id="r395"></a><a href="#f395" class="c014"><sup>[395]</sup></a> bazar at
Cairo, when I saw this soldier receive the gold in change and put
it in yonder purse; so I followed him from by-street to by-street,
but found no occasion of stealing it. Then he travelled from
Cairo and I followed him from town to town, plotting and planning
by the way to rob him, but without avail, till he entered this
city and I dogged him to the khan. I took up my lodging beside
him and watched him till he fell asleep and I heard him sleeping;
when I went up to him softly, softly; and I slit open his saddle-bags
with this knife, and took the purse in the way I am now
taking it.” So saying, he put out his hand and took the purse
from before the Chief of Police and the trooper both of whom,
together with the folk, drew back watching him and thinking he
would show them how he took the purse from the saddle-bags.
But, behold! he suddenly broke into a run and threw himself into
a pool of standing water<a id="r396"></a><a href="#f396" class="c014"><sup>[396]</sup></a> hard by. So the Chief of the Police
shouted to his officers, “Stop thief!” and many made after him;
but before they could doff their clothes and descend the steps, he
had made off; and they sought for him, but found him not; for
that the by-streets and lanes of Alexandria all communicate. So
they came back without bringing the purse; and the Chief of
Police said to the trooper, “Thou hast no demand upon the folk;
for thou foundest him who robbed thee and receivedst back thy
money, but didst not keep it.” So the trooper went away, having
lost his money, whilst the folk were delivered from his hands and
those of the Chief of Police; and all this was of the favour of

<h3 id="c271b" class="c016"><em>THE STORY OF THE CHIEF OF POLICE OF CAIRO.</em></h3>

<p class="c017">There were in this city two men of good repute fit to bear witness<a id="r400"></a><a href="#f400" class="c014"><sup>[400]</sup></a><a id="p271"></a>
in matters of murder and wounds; but they were both secretly
addicted to intrigues with low women and to wine-bibbing and to
dissolute doings, nor could I succeed (do what I would) in bringing
them to book; and I began to despair of success. So I charged
<span class="pageno" id="Page_272">272</span>the taverners and confectioners and fruiterers and candle-chandlers
and the keepers of brothels and bawdy houses to acquaint me of
these two good men whenever they should anywhere be engaged
in drinking or other debauchery, or together or apart; and ordered
that, if they both or if either of them bought at their shops aught for
the purpose of wassail and carousal, the vendors should not conceal
it from me. And they replied, “We hear and obey.” Presently
it chanced that one night, a man came to me and said, “O my
master, know that the two just men, the two witnesses, are in such
a street in such a house, engaged in abominable wickedness.” So
I disguised myself, I and my body-servant, and ceased not trudging
till I came to the house and knocked at the door, whereupon a
slave-girl came out and opened to me, saying, “Who art thou?” I
entered without answering her and saw the two legal witnesses and
the house-master sitting, and lewd women by their side and before
them great plenty of wine. When they saw me, they rose to
receive me, and made much of me, seating me in the place of
honour and saying to me, “Welcome for an illustrious guest and
well come for a pleasant cup-companion!” And on this wise they
met me without showing a sign of alarm or trouble. Presently,
the master of the house arose from amongst us and went out and
returned after a while with three hundred dinars, when the men
said to me, without the least fear, “Know, O our lord the Wali, it
is in thy power to do even more than disgrace and punish us; but
this will bring thee in return nothing but weariness: so we reck
thou wouldest do better to take this much money and protect us;
for Almighty Allah is named the Protector and loveth those of His
servants who protect their Moslem neighbours; and thou shalt
have thy reward in this world and due recompense in the world to
come.” So I said to myself, “I will take the money and protect
them this once; but, if ever again I have them in my power, I will
take my wreak of them;” for, you see, the money had tempted
me. Thereupon I took it and went away thinking that no one
would know it; but, next day, on a sudden one of the Kazi’s
messengers came to me and said to me, “O Wali, be good enough
to answer the summons of the Kazi who wanteth thee.” So I
arose and accompanied him, knowing not the meaning of all this;
and when I came into the judge’s presence, I saw the two witnesses
and the master of the house, who had given me the money, sitting
by his side. Thereupon this man rose and sued me for three hundred
dinars, nor was it in my power to deny the debt; for he
<span class="pageno" id="Page_273">273</span>produced a written obligation and his two companions, the legal
witnesses, testified against me that I owed the amount. Their
evidence satisfied the Kazi and he ordered me to pay the sum; nor
did I leave the Court till they had of me the three hundred gold
pieces. So I went away, in the utmost wrath and shame, vowing
mischief and vengeance against them and repenting that I had not
punished them. Such, then is the most remarkable event which
befel me during my term of office. Thereupon rose the Chief of
the Bulak Police and said, “As for me, O our lord the Sultan, the
most marvellous thing that happened to me, since I became Wali,
was as follows:” and he began</p>

company of the same fashion and he asketh for thee.” So I took my
sword and going out to see who these were, behold, I found them
<span class="pageno" id="Page_274">274</span>as the boy had reported and said to them, “What is your business?”
They replied, “Of a truth we be thieves and have done
fine work this night; so we appointed the swag to thy use, that thou
mayst pay therewith the debts which sadden thee and deliver thee
from thy distress.” Quoth I, “Where is the plunder?”; and they
brought me a great chest, full of vessels of gold and silver; which
when I saw, I rejoiced and said to myself, “Herewith I will settle
all claims upon me and there will remain as much again.” So I
took the money and going inside said in my mind, “It were ignoble
to let them fare away empty-handed.” Whereupon I brought out
the hundred thousand dinars I had by me and gave it to them,
thanking them for their kindness; and they pouched the monies
and went their way, under cover of the night so that none might
know of them. But when morning dawned I examined the contents
of the chest, and found them copper and tin<a id="r402"></a><a href="#f402" class="c014"><sup>[402]</sup></a> washed with
gold worth five hundred dirhams at the most; and this was
grievous to me, for I had lost what monies I had and trouble
was added to my trouble. Such, then, is the most remarkable
event which befel me during my term of office. Then rose the
Chief of the Police of Old Cairo and said, “O our lord the Sultan,
the most marvellous thing that happened to me, since I became
Wali, was on this wise;” and he began</p>

<h3 id="c274" class="c016"><em>THE STORY OF THE CHIEF OF THE OLD CAIRO POLICE.</em></h3>

<p class="c017">I once hanged ten thieves each on his own gibbet, and especially
charged the guards to watch them and hinder the folk from taking
any one of them down. Next morning when I came to look at
them, I found two bodies hanging from one gallows and said to the
guards, “Who did this, and where is the tenth gibbet?” But they
denied all knowledge of it, and I was about to beat them till they
owned the truth, when they said, “Know, O Emir, that we fell
asleep last night, and when we awoke, we found that some one had
stolen one of the bodies, gibbet and all; so we were alarmed and
feared thy wrath. But, behold, up came a peasant-fellow driving
his ass; whereupon we laid hands on him and killed him and
hanged his body upon this gallows, in the stead of the thief who
<span class="pageno" id="Page_275">275</span>had been stolen.”<a id="r403"></a><a href="#f403" class="c014"><sup>[403]</sup></a> Now when I heard this, I marvelled and asked
them, “What had he with him?”; and they answered, “He had a
pair of saddle-bags on the ass.” Quoth I, “What was in them?”;
quoth they, “We know not.” So I said, “Bring them hither;”
and when they brought them to me I bade open them, behold,
therein was the body of a murdered man, cut in pieces. Now as
soon as I saw this, I marvelled at the case and said in myself,
“Glory to God! The cause of the hanging of this peasant was
none other but his crime against this murdered man; and thy
Lord is not unjust towards His servants.”<a id="r404"></a><a href="#f404" class="c014"><sup>[404]</sup></a> And men also tell

“I, and I only, have the power to steal yonder purse.” So they
asked, “How wilt thou do it?”; and he answered, “Lookye all!”;
and followed the money-changer, till he entered his house, when he
threw the bag on a shelf<a id="r405"></a><a href="#f405" class="c014"><sup>[405]</sup></a> and, being affected with diabetes, went
into the chapel of ease to do his want, calling to the slave-girl,
“Bring me an ewer of water.” She took the ewer and followed him
to the privy, leaving the door open, whereupon the thief entered
and, seizing the money-bag, made off with it to his companions, to

worthy of praise; so, if thou be indeed a sharper, return and save
the girl from being beaten and questioned.” Quoth he, “Inshallah!
I will save both girl and purse.” Then the prig went back to the
Shroff’s house and found him punishing the girl because of the
purse; so he knocked at the door and the man said, “Who is
there?” Cried the thief, “I am the servant of thy neighbour in
the Exchange;” whereupon he came out to him and said, “What
is thy business?” The thief replied, “My master saluteth thee
and saith to thee:—Surely thou art deranged and thoroughly so,
to cast the like of this bag of money down at the door of thy shop
and go away and leave it. Had a stranger hit upon it he had
made off with it and, except my master had seen it and taken care
of it, it had assuredly been lost to thee.” So saying, he pulled out
the purse and showed it to the Shroff who on seeing it said, “That
is my very purse,” and put out his hand to take it; but the thief
said, “By Allah, I will not give thee this same, till thou write me a
receipt declaring that thou hast received it! for indeed I fear my
master will not believe that thou hast recovered the purse, unless I
bring him thy writing to that effect, and sealed with thy signet-seal.”

I am in thy district and under thine inspection. Now I have here

  <h2 id="c278" class="c007">IBRAHIM BIN AL-MAHDI AND THE MERCHANT’S SISTER.</h2>
</div>

<p class="c013">The Caliph Al-Maamún once said to his uncle Ibrahim bin Al-Mahdí,
“Tell us the most remarkable thing that thou hast ever
seen.” Answered he:—I hear and obey, O Commander of the
Faithful. Know that I rode out one day, a-pleasuring, and my
ride brought me to a place where I smelt the reek of food. So
my soul longed for it and I halted, O Prince of True Believers,
perplexed and unable either to go on or to go in. Presently, I
raised my eyes and lo! I espied a lattice-window and behind it a
wrist, than which I never beheld aught lovelier. The sight turned
my brain and I forgot the smell of the food and began to plan and
plot how I should get access to the house. After awhile, I observed
a tailor hard by and going up to him, saluted him. He returned
my salam and I asked him, “Whose house is that?” And he
answered, “It belongeth to a merchant called such an one, son of
such an one, who consorteth with none save merchants.” As we
were talking, behold, up came two men, of comely aspect with
intelligent countenances, riding on horseback; and the tailor told
me that they were the merchant’s most intimate friends and
acquainted me with their names. So I urged my beast towards
them and said to them, “Be I your ransom! Abu Fulán<a id="r408"></a><a href="#f408" class="c014"><sup>[408]</sup></a> awaiteth
you!”; and I rode with them both to the gate, where I entered
and they also. Now when the master of the house saw me with
them he doubted not but I was their friend; so he welcomed me
and seated me in the highest stead. Then they brought the table
of food and I said in myself, “Allah hath granted me my desire
of the food; and now there remain the hand and the wrist.” After
awhile, we removed for carousal to another room, which I found
tricked out with all manner of rarities; and the host paid me
particular attention, addressing his talk to me, for that he took
<span class="pageno" id="Page_279">279</span>me to be a guest of his guests; whilst in like manner these two
made much of me, taking me for a friend of their friend the house-master.
Thus I was the object of politest attentions till we had
drunk several cups of wine and there came into us a damsel as she
were a willow-wand of the utmost beauty and elegance, who took
a lute and playing a lively measure, sang these couplets:—</p>

<div class="lg-container-b c003">
  <div class="linegroup">
    <div class="group">
      <div class="line">Is it not strange one house us two contain ✿ And still thou draw’st not near, or talk we twain?</div>
      <div class="line">Only our eyes tell secrets of our souls, ✿ And broken hearts by lovers’ fiery pain;</div>
      <div class="line">Winks with the eyelids, signs the eyebrow knows; ✿ Languishing looks and hand saluting fain.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class="c000">When I heard these words my vitals were stirred, O Commander
of the Faithful, and I was moved to delight, for her excessive
loveliness and the beauty of the verses she sang; and I envied her
her skill and said, “There lacketh somewhat to thee, O damsel!”
Whereupon she threw the lute from her hand in anger, and cried,
“Since when are ye wont to bring ill-mannered louts into your
assemblies?” Then I repented of what I had done, seeing the
company vexed with me, and I said in my mind, “My hopes are
lost by me”; and I weeted no way of escaping blame but to call
for a lute, saying, “I will show you what escaped her in the air
she played.” Quoth the folk, “We hear and obey”; so they
brought me a lute and I tuned the strings and sang these verses:—</p>

<div class="lg-container-b c003">
  <div class="linegroup">
    <div class="group">
      <div class="line">This is thy friend perplexed for pain and pine, ✿ Th’ enamoured, down whose breast course drops of brine:</div>
      <div class="line">He hath this hand to the Compassionate raised ✿ For winning wish, and that on hearts is lien:</div>
      <div class="line">O thou who seest one love-perishing, ✿ His death is caused by those hands and eyne!<a id="r409"></a><a href="#f409" class="c014"><sup>[409]</sup></a></div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class="c000">Whereupon the damsel sprang up and throwing herself at my feet,
kissed them and said, “It is thine to excuse, O my Master! By
Allah, I knew not thy quality nor heard I ever the like of this
performance!” And all began extolling me and making much of
me, being beyond measure delighted, and at last they besought me
<span class="pageno" id="Page_280">280</span>to sing again. So I sang a merry air, whereupon they all became
drunken with music and wine, their wits left them and they were
carried off to their homes, while I abode alone with the host and
the girl. He drank some cups with me and then said, “O my
lord, my life hath been lived in vain for that I have not known
the like of thee till the present. Now, by Allah, tell me who
thou art, that I may ken who is the cup-companion whom Allah
hath bestowed on me this night.” At first I returned him evasive
answers and would not tell him my name; but he conjured me till
I told him who I was; whereupon he sprang to his feet——And
Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her
permitted say.</p>

<p class="c000">She said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that Ibrahim son
of Al-Mahdi continued:—Now when the house-master heard my
name he sprang to his feet and said, “Indeed I wondered that
such gifts should belong to any but the like of thee; and Fortune
hath done me a good turn for which I cannot thank her too much.
But, haply, this is a dream; for how could I hope that one of the
Caliphate house should visit my humble home and carouse with
me this night?” I conjured him to be seated; so he sat down
and began to question me as to the cause of my visit in the most
courteous terms. So I told him the whole affair, first and last,
hiding naught, and said to him, “Now as to the food I have had
my will, but of the hand and wrist I have still to win my wish.”
Quoth he, “Thou shalt have thy desire of the hand and wrist also,
Inshallah!” Then said he to the slave-girl, “Ho, such an one,
bid such an one come down.” And he called his slave-girls down,
one by one and showed them to me; but I saw not my mistress
among them, and he said, “O my lord, there is none left save my
mother and sister; but, by Allah, I must needs have them also
down and show them to thee.” So I marvelled at his courtesy and
large-heartedness and said, “May I be thy sacrifice! Begin with
the sister;” and he answered, “With joy and goodwill.” So she
came down and he showed me her hand and behold, she was the
owner of the hand and wrist. Quoth I, “Allah make me thy
ransom! this is the damsel whose hand and wrist I saw at the
lattice.” Then he sent his servants without stay or delay for
<span class="pageno" id="Page_281">281</span>witnesses and bringing out two myriads<a id="r410"></a><a href="#f410" class="c014"><sup>[410]</sup></a> of gold pieces, said to
the witnesses, “This our lord and master, Ibrahim son of Al-Mahdi,
paternal uncle of the Commander of the Faithful, seeketh in
marriage my sister such an one; and I call you to witness that I
give her in wedlock to him and that he hath settled upon her ten
thousand dinars.” And he said to me, “I give thee my sister in
marriage, at the portion aforesaid.” “I consent,” answered I,
“and am herewith content.” Whereupon he gave one of the
bags to her and the other to the witnesses, and said to me, “O
our lord, I desire to adorn a chamber for thee, where thou mayst
sleep with thy wife.” But I was abashed at his generosity and was
ashamed to lie with her in his house; so I said, “Equip her and
send her to my place.” “And by thy being, O Commander of
the Faithful, he sent me with her such an equipage that my
house, for all its greatness, was too strait to hold it! And
I begot on her this boy that standeth in thy presence.” Then
Al-Maamun marvelled at the man’s generosity and said, “Gifted
of Allah is he! Never heard I of his like.” And he bade
Ibrahim bin al-Mahdi bring him to court, that he might see him.
He brought him and the Caliph conversed with him; and his wit
and good breeding so pleased him that he made him one of his
chief officers. And Allah is the Giver, the Bestower! Men also

beggar to the woman, “Give me an alms however small.” But
she answered him, “How can I give thee aught, when the King
cutteth off the hands of all who give alms?” Then he said, “I
conjure thee by Allah Almighty, give me an alms;” so when he
adjured her by the Holy Name of Allah, she had ruth on him and
gave him two scones. The King heard of this; whereupon he
called her before him and cut off her hands, after which she
returned to her house. Now it chanced after a while that the
King said to his mother, “I have a mind to take a wife; so do
thou marry me to a fair woman.” Quoth she, “There is among
our female slaves one who is unsurpassed in beauty; but she hath
a grievous blemish.” The King asked, “What is that?” and his
mother answered, “She hath had both her hands cut off.” Said he,
“Let me see her.” So she brought her to him, and he was
ravished by her and married her and went in unto her; and
begat upon her a son. Now this was the woman who had given
two scones as an alms to the asker, and whose hands had been cut
off therefor; and when the King married her, her fellow-wives
envied her and wrote to the common husband that she was an
unchaste, having just given birth to the boy; so he wrote to his
mother, bidding her carry the woman into the desert and leave her
there. The old Queen obeyed his commandment and abandoned
the woman and her son in the desert; whereupon she fell to weeping
for that which had befallen her and wailing with exceeding
sore wail. As she went along, she came to a river and knelt down
to drink, being overcome with excess of thirst, for fatigue of walking
and for grief; but, as she bent her head, the child which was
at her neck fell into the water. Then she sat weeping bitter tears
for her child, and as she wept, behold came up two men, who said
to her, “What maketh thee weep?” Quoth she, “I had a child at
my neck, and he hath fallen into the water.” They asked, “Wilt
thou that we bring him out to thee?” and she answered, “Yes.”
So they prayed to Almighty Allah, and the child came forth of
the water to her, safe and sound. Then said they, “Wilt thou that
Allah restore thee thy hands as they were?” “Yes,” replied she:
whereupon they prayed to Allah (extolled and exalted be He!)

<p class="c000"><span class="label"><a href="#r412">412</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>There is a picturesque Moslem idea that good deeds become incarnate and assume
human shapes to cheer the doer in his grave, to greet him when he enters Paradise
and so forth. It was borrowed from the highly imaginative faith of the Guebre, the
Zoroastrian. On Chinavad or Chanyud-pul (Sirát), the Judgement bridge 37 rods
(<em>rasan</em>) long, straight and 37 fathoms broad for the good, and crooked and narrow as
sword-edge for the bad, a nymph-like form will appear to the virtuous and say, “I am
the personification of thy good deeds!” In Hell there will issue from a fetid gale a
gloomy figure with head like a minaret, red eyeballs, hooked nose, teeth like pillars,
spear-like fangs, snaky locks etc., and when asked who he is he will reply, “I am the
personification of thine evil acts!” (Dabistan i. 285.) The Hindus also personify everything.</p>

  <h2 id="c283" class="c007">THE DEVOUT ISRAELITE.</h2>

<p class="c013">There was once a devout man of the children of Israel,<a id="r413"></a><a href="#f413" class="c014"><sup>[413]</sup></a> whose
family span cotton-thread; and he used every day to sell the yarn
and buy fresh cotton, and with the profit he laid in daily bread for
his household. One morning he went out and sold the day’s yarn
as wont, when there met him one of his brethren, who complained
to him of need; so he gave him the price of the thread and returned,
empty-handed, to his family, who said to him, “Where is
the cotton and the food?” Quoth he, “Such an one met me and
complained to me of want; whereupon I gave him the price of
the yarn.” And they said, “How shall we do? We have nothing
to sell.” Now they had a cracked trencher<a id="r414"></a><a href="#f414" class="c014"><sup>[414]</sup></a> and a jar; so he took
<span class="pageno" id="Page_284">284</span>them to the bazar but none would buy them of him. However
presently, as he stood in the market, there passed by a man with
a fish——And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased

<p class="c000">She said, it hath reached me, O auspicious King, that the man
took the trencher and jar to the bazar, but none would buy them
of him. However there presently passed by a man with a fish
which was so stinking and so swollen that no one would buy
it of him, and he said to the Jew, “Wilt thou sell me thine unsaleable
ware for mine?” “Yes,” answered the Jew; and, giving
him the wooden trencher and jar, took the fish and carried it
home to his family, who said, “What shall we do with this fish?”
Quoth he, “We will broil it and eat it, till it please Allah to provide
bread for us.” So they took it and ripping open its belly,
found therein a great pearl and told the head of the household
who said, “See ye if it be pierced: if so, it belongeth to some one
of the folk; if not, ‘tis a provision of Allah for us.” So they
examined it and found it unpierced. Now when it was the morrow,
the Jew carried it to one of his brethren which was an expert
in jewels, and the man asked, “O such an one! whence haddest
thou this pearl?”; whereto the Jew answered, “It was a gift of
Almighty Allah to us,” and the other said, “It is worth a thousand
dirhams and I will give thee that; but take it to such an one, for
he hath more money and skill than I.” So the Jew took it to the
jeweller, who said, “It is worth seventy thousand dirhams and no
more.” Then he paid him that sum and the Jew hired two porters
to carry the money to his house. As he came to his door, a
beggar accosted him, saying, “Give me of that which Allah hath
given thee.” Quoth the Jew to the asker, “But yesterday we
were even as thou; take thee half this money:” so he made two
parts of it, and each took his half. Then said the beggar, “Take
back thy money and Allah bless and prosper thee in it; I am a
Messenger,<a id="r415"></a><a href="#f415" class="c014"><sup>[415]</sup></a> whom thy Lord hath sent to try thee.” Quoth the

and so needy that the grocer, the baker and other tradesmen dunned
and importuned me; and my misery became extreme, for I knew
of no resource nor what to do. Things being on this wise there
came to me one day certain of my servants and said to me, “At
the door is a pilgrim wight, who seeketh admission to thee.”
Quoth I, “Admit him.” So he came in and behold, he was a
Khorasání. We exchanged salutations and he said to me, “Tell
me, art thou Abu Hassan al-Ziyadi?”; and I replied, “Yes, what is
thy wish?” Quoth he, “I am a stranger and am minded to make
the pilgrimage; but I have with me a great sum of money, which
is burdensome to bear: so I wish to deposit these ten thousand
dirhams with thee whilst I make my pilgrimage and return. If
the caravan march back and thou see me not, then know that I
am dead, in which case the money is a gift from me to thee; but
if I come back, it shall be mine.” I answered, “Be it as thou
wilt, an thus please Allah Almighty.” So he brought out a
leather bag and I said to the servant, “Fetch the scales;” and
when he brought them the man weighed out the money and
handed it to me, after which he went his way. Then I called
the purveyors and paid them my liabilities——And Shahrazad
perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say</p>

<p class="c000">She said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that quoth Abu
Hassan al-Ziyadi:—I called the purveyors and paid them my
liabilities and spent freely and amply, saying to myself, “By the
<span class="pageno" id="Page_286">286</span>time he returns, Allah will have relieved me with one or other of
the bounties He hath by Him.” However, on the very next day.
the servant came in to me and said, “Thy friend the Khorasan
man is at the door.” “Admit him,” answered I. So he came in
and said to me, “I had purposed to make the pilgrimage; but
news hath reached me of the decease of my father, and I have
resolved to return; so give me the monies I deposited with thee
yesterday.” When I heard this, I was troubled and perplexed
beyond measure of perplexity known to man and wotted not what
reply to make him; for, if I denied it, he would put me on my
oath, and I should be disgraced in the world to come; whilst, if I
told him that I had spent the money, he would make an outcry
and dishonour me before men. So I said to him, “Allah give thee
health! This my house is no stronghold nor site of safe custody
for this money. When I received thy leather bag, I sent it to one
with whom it now is; so do thou return to us to-morrow and take
thy money, Inshallah!”<a id="r417"></a><a href="#f417" class="c014"><sup>[417]</sup></a> So he went away and I passed the
night in great concern, because of his return to me; sleep visited
me not nor could I close my eyes; so I rose and bade the boy
saddle me the she-mule. Answered he, “O my lord, it is yet but
the first third of the night and indeed we have hardly had time to
rest.” I returned to my bed, but sleep was forbidden to me and I
ceased not to awaken the boy, and he to put me off, till break of
day, when he saddled me the mule, and I mounted and rode out,
not knowing whither to go. I threw the reins on the mule’s
shoulders and gave myself up to regrets and melancholy thoughts,
whilst she fared on with me to the eastward of Baghdad. Presently,
as I went along, behold, I saw a number of people approaching
me and turned aside into another path to avoid them;
but seeing that I wore a turband in preacher-fashion,<a id="r418"></a><a href="#f418" class="c014"><sup>[418]</sup></a> they followed
me and hastening up to me, said, “Knowest thou the lodging of
Abu Hassan al-Ziyadi?” “I am he,” answered I; and they rejoined,
“Obey the summons of the Commander of the Faithful.”
Then they carried me before Al-Maamun, who said to me, “Who
<span class="pageno" id="Page_287">287</span>art thou?” Quoth I, “An associate of the Kazi Abu Yúsuf and
a doctor of the law and traditions.” Asked the Caliph, “By what
surname art thou known?”<a id="r419"></a><a href="#f419" class="c014"><sup>[419]</sup></a> and I answered, “Abu Hassan al-Ziyadi;”
whereupon quoth he, “Expound to me thy case.” So I
recounted to him my case and he wept sore and said to me, “Out
on thee!” The Apostle of Allah (whom Allah bless and assain!)
would not let me sleep this night, because of thee; for in early
darkness<a id="r420"></a><a href="#f420" class="c014"><sup>[420]</sup></a> he appeared to me and said, “Succour Abu Hassan
al-Ziyadi.” Whereupon I awoke and, knowing thee not, went to
sleep again; but he came to me a second time and said to me,
“Woe to thee! Succour Abu Hassan al-Ziyadi.” I awoke a
second time, but knowing thee not I went to sleep again; and he
came to me a third time and still I knew thee not and went to
sleep again. Then he came to me once more and said, “Out on
thee! Succour Abu Hassan al-Ziyadi!” “After that I dared not
sleep any more, but watched the rest of the night and aroused my
people and sent them on all sides in quest of thee.” Then he gave
me one myriad of dirhams, saying, “This is for the Khorasani,”
and other ten thousand, saying, “Spend freely of this and amend
thy case therewith, and set thine affairs in order.” Moreover, he
presented me with thirty thousand dirhams, saying, “Furnish thyself
with this, and when the Procession-day<a id="r421"></a><a href="#f421" class="c014"><sup>[421]</sup></a> is being kept, come
thou to me, that I may invest thee with some office.” So I went
forth from him with the money and returned home, where I prayed
the dawn-prayer; and behold, presently came the Khorasani, so I
carried him into the house and brought out to him one myriad of
dirhams, saying, “Here is thy money.” Quoth he, “It is not my
very money; how cometh this?” So I told him the whole story,
and he wept and said, “By Allah, haddest thou told me the fact
at first, I had not pressed thee!; and now, by Allah, I will not
accept aught of this money”——And Shahrazad perceived the

So saying, he went away and I set my affairs in order and repaired
on the Procession-day to Al-Maamun’s Gate, where I found him
seated. When he saw me present myself he called me to him and,
bringing forth to me a paper from under his prayer-carpet, said to
me, “This is a patent, conferring on thee the office of Kazi of the

folk marvelled at the Caliph’s words and asked me their meaning;
whereupon I told them the story from beginning to end and it spread
abroad amongst the people. “And” (quoth he who telleth the tale)

containing thirty thousand dinars, besides jewels and bullion of
high value, saying, “This was deposited with us in trust by thy
father.” Then they went away; and presently there came to him
a woman, who sought of him certain of the jewels, worth five

carrying them to his friend who had lent him the money, said to

<p class="c013">There lived once in Baghdad a wealthy man and made of money,
who lost all his substance and became so destitute that he could
earn his living only by hard labour. One night, he lay down to
sleep, dejected and heavy hearted, and saw in a dream a Speaker<a id="r424"></a><a href="#f424" class="c014"><sup>[424]</sup></a>
who said to him, “Verily thy fortune is in Cairo; go thither and
<span class="pageno" id="Page_290">290</span>seek it.” So he set out for Cairo; but when he arrived there,
evening overtook him and he lay down to sleep in a mosque.
Presently, by decree of Allah Almighty, a band of bandits entered
the mosque and made their way thence into an adjoining house;
but the owners, being aroused by the noise of the thieves, awoke
and cried out; whereupon the Chief of Police came to their aid
with his officers. The robbers made off; but the Wali entered the
mosque and, finding the man from Baghdad asleep there, laid hold
of him and beat him with palm-rods so grievous a beating that
he was well-nigh dead. Then they cast him into jail, where he
abode three days; after which the Chief of Police sent for him
and asked him, “Whence art thou?”; and he answered, “From
Baghdad.” Quoth the Wali, “And what brought thee to Cairo?”;
and quoth the Baghdadi, “I saw in a dream One who said to
me, Thy fortune is in Cairo; go thither to it. But when I came
to Cairo the fortune which he promised me proved to be the palm-rods
thou so generously gavest to me.” The Wali laughed till
he showed his wisdom-teeth and said, “O man of little wit, thrice
have I seen in a dream one who said to me:—There is in
Baghdad a house in such a district and of such a fashion and
its courtyard is laid out garden-wise, at the lower end whereof
is a jetting-fountain and under the same a great sum of money
lieth buried. Go thither and take it. Yet I went not; but thou,

  <h2 id="c291" class="c007">CALIPH AL-MUTAWAKKIL AND HIS CONCUBINE MAHBUBAH.</h2>
</div>

<p class="c013">There were in the palace of the Caliph Al-Mutawakkil ala’llah<a id="r425"></a><a href="#f425" class="c014"><sup>[425]</sup></a>
four thousand concubines, whereof two thousand were Greeks and
other two thousand slave-born Arabians<a id="r426"></a><a href="#f426" class="c014"><sup>[426]</sup></a> and Abyssinians; and
‘Obayd ibn Táhir<a id="r427"></a><a href="#f427" class="c014"><sup>[427]</sup></a> had given him two hundred white girls and a
like number of Abyssinian and native girls. Among these slave-borns
was a girl of Bassorah, hight Mahbúbah, the Beloved, who
was of surpassing beauty and loveliness, elegance and voluptuous
grace. Moreover, she played upon the lute and was skilled in
singing and making verses and wrote a beautiful hand; so that
Al-Mutawakkil fell passionately in love with her and could not
endure from her a single hour. But when she saw this affection,
she presumed upon his favour to use him arrogantly, wherefore he
waxed exceeding wroth with her and forsook her, forbidding the
people of the palace to speak with her. She abode on this wise
some days, but the Caliph still inclined to her; and he arose one
morning and said to his courtiers, “I dreamt, last night, that I
was reconciled to Mahbubah.” They answered, “Would Allah this
might be on wake!”; and as they were talking, behold, in came
one of the Caliph’s maidservants and whispered him; so he rose
from his throne and entered the Serraglio; for the whisper had
said, “Of a truth we heard singing and lute-playing in Mahbubah’s
chamber and we knew not what this meant.” So he went straight
to her apartment, where he heard her playing upon the lute and
singing the following verses:—</p>

<div class="lg-container-b c003">
  <div class="linegroup">
    <div class="group">
      <div class="line">I wander through the palace, but I sight there not a soul ✿ To whom I may complain or will ‘change a word with me.</div>

      <div class="line">But when the break of day arose and showed itself again, ✿ Then he departing sent me back to dree my privacy?</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class="c000">Now when the Caliph heard her voice, he marvelled at the verse
and yet more at the strange coincidence of their dreams and
entered the chamber. As soon as she perceived him, she hastened
to rise and throw herself at his feet, and kissing them, said, “By
Allah, O my lord, this hap is what I dreamt last night; and, when
I awoke, I made the couplets thou hast heard.” Replied Al-Mutawakkil,
“By Allah, I also dreamt the like!” Then they
embraced and made friends and he abode with her seven days

  <h2 id="c293" class="c007">WARDAN<a id="r429"></a><a href="#f429" class="c014"><sup>[429]</sup></a> THE BUTCHER HIS ADVENTURE WITH THE LADY AND THE BEAR.</h2>
</div>

<p class="c013">There lived once in Cairo, in the days of the Caliph Al-Hákim
bi´ Amri´llah, a butcher named Wardán, who dealt in sheep’s flesh;
and there came to him every day a lady and gave him a dinar,
whose weight was nigh two and a half Egyptian dinars, saying,
“Give me a lamb.” So he took the money and gave her the lamb,
which she delivered to a porter she had with her; and he put it in
his crate and she went away with him to her own place. Next
day she came in the forenoon and this went on for a long time, the
butcher gaining a dinar by her every day, till at last he began to
be curious about her case and said to himself, “This woman buyeth
of me a ducat-worth of meat every morning, paying ready money,
and never misseth a single day. Verily, this is a strange thing!”
So he took an occasion of questioning the porter, in her absence,
and asked him, “Whither goest thou every day with yonder
woman?”; and he answered, “I know not what to make of her for
surprise; inasmuch as every day, after she hath taken the lamb of
thee, she buyeth necessaries of the table, fresh and dried fruits and
wax-candles a dinar’s worth, and taketh of a certain person, which
is a Nazarene, two flagons of wine, worth another dinar; and then
she leadeth me with the whole and I go with her to the Wazir’s
Gardens, where she blindfoldeth me, so that I cannot see on what
part of earth I set my feet; and, taking me by the hand, she
leadeth me I know not whither. Presently, she sayeth, “Set down
here;” and when I have done so, she giveth me an empty crate
she hath ready and, taking my hand, leadeth me back to the
Wazir’s Gardens, the place where she bound my eyes, and there
removeth the bandage and giveth me ten silver bits.” “Allah be
her helper!” quoth Wardan; but he redoubled in curiosity about
her case; disquietude increased upon him and he passed the night
in exceeding restlessness. And quoth the butcher:—Next morning
she came to me as of custom and taking the lamb, for which
she paid the dinar, delivered it to the porter and went away. So
<span class="pageno" id="Page_294">294</span>I gave my shop in charge to a lad and followed her without her
seeing me;——And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and
ceased to say her permitted say.</p>

<div>

<div class="nf-center-c1">
<div class="nf-center c005">
    <div>Now when it was the Three Hundred and Fifty-fourth Night,</div>
  </div>
</div>

</div>

<p class="c000">She said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that Wardan the
butcher continued:—So I gave my shop in charge to a lad and
followed her without her seeing me; nor did I cease to keep her in
sight, hiding behind her, till she left Cairo and came to the Wazir’s
Gardens. Then I hid myself whilst she bandaged the porter’s eyes
and followed her again from place to place till she came to the
mountain<a id="r430"></a><a href="#f430" class="c014"><sup>[430]</sup></a> and stopped at a spot where there was a great stone.
Here she made the porter set down his crate, and I waited whilst
she conducted him back to the Wazir’s Gardens, after which she
returned and, taking out the contents of the basket, instantly disappeared.
Then I went up to that stone and wrenching it up
entered the hole and found behind the stone an open trap-door of
brass and a flight of steps leading downwards. So I descended,
little by little, till I came to a long corridor, brilliantly lighted,
and followed it, till I made a closed door, as it were the door of
a saloon. I looked about the wall-sides near the doorway till I discovered
a recess, with steps therein; then climbed up and found a
little niche with a bulls-eye giving upon a saloon. Thence I looked
inside and saw the lady cut off the choicest parts of the lamb and
laying them in a saucepan, throw the rest to a great big bear, who
ate it all to the last bite. Now when she had made an end of cooking,
she ate her fill, after which she set on the fruits and confections
and brought out the wine and fell to drinking a cup herself and
giving the bear to drink in a basin of gold. And as soon as she
was heated with wine, she put off her petticoat-trousers and lay
down on her back; whereupon the bear arose and came up to her
and stroked her, whilst she gave him the best of what belongeth to
the sons of Adam till he had made an end, when he sat down and
rested. Presently, he sprang upon her and rogered her again; and
when he ended he again sat down to rest; and he ceased not so
doing till he had futtered her ten times and they both fell to the
ground in a fainting-fit and lay without motion. Then quoth I to
<span class="pageno" id="Page_295">295</span>myself, “Now is my opportunity,” and taking a knife I had with
me, that would cut bones before flesh,<a id="r431"></a><a href="#f431" class="c014"><sup>[431]</sup></a> went down to them and
found them motionless, not a muscle of them moving for their
hard swinking and swiving. So I put my knife to the bear’s gullet
and pressed upon it, till I finished him by severing his head from
his body, and he gave a great snort like thunder, whereat the lady
started up in alarm; and, seeing the bear slain and me standing
whittle in hand, she shrieked so loud a shriek that I thought the
soul had left her body. Then she asked, “O Wardan, is this how
thou requitest me my favours?” And I answered, “O enemy of
thine own soul, is there a famine of men<a id="r432"></a><a href="#f432" class="c014"><sup>[432]</sup></a> that thou must do this
damnable thing?” She made no answer but bent down over the
bear, and looked fondly upon him; then finding his head divided
from his body, said to me, “O Wardan, which of the two courses
wouldst thou take; either obey me in what I shall say and be the
means of thine own safety”——And Shahrazad perceived the dawn
of day and ceased saying her permitted say.</p>

<div>

<div class="nf-center-c1">
<div class="nf-center c005">
    <div>Now when it was the Three Hundred and Fifty-fifth Night,</div>
  </div>
</div>

</div>

<p class="c000">She said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that quoth the
lady, “O Wardan, which of the two courses wouldst thou take;
either obey me in what I shall say and be the means of thine
own safety and competency to the end of thy days, or gainsay
me and so cause thine own destruction?”<a id="r433"></a><a href="#f433" class="c014"><sup>[433]</sup></a> Answered I, “I choose
rather to hearken unto thee: say what thou wilt.” Quoth she,
“Then slay me, as thou hast slain this bear, and take thy need of
this hoard and wend thy ways.” Quoth I, “I am better than this
bear: so return thou to Allah Almighty and repent, and I will
marry thee, and we will live on this treasure the rest of our lives.”
She rejoined, “O Wardan, far be it from me! How shall I live
after him? By Allah, an thou slay me not I will assuredly do away
thy life! So leave bandying words with me, or thou art a lost
man: this is all I have to say to thee and peace be with thee!”
Then said I, “I will kill thee, and thou shalt go to the curse of
Allah.” So saying, I caught her by the hair and cut her throat;
and she went to the curse of Allah and of the angels and of all
<span class="pageno" id="Page_296">296</span>mankind. And after so doing I examined the place and found
there gold and bezel-stones and pearls, such as no one king could
bring together. So I filled the porter’s crate with as much as I
could carry and covered it with the clothes I had on me. Then
I shouldered it and, going up out of the under-ground treasure-chamber,
fared homewards and ceased not faring on, till I came to
the gate of Cairo, where behold, I fell in with ten of the body-guard
of Al-Hakim bi´ Amri´llah<a id="r434"></a><a href="#f434" class="c014"><sup>[434]</sup></a> followed by the Prince himself, who
said to me, “Ho, Wardan!” “At thy service, O King,” replied
I; when he asked, “Hast thou killed the bear and the lady?”
and I answered, “Yes.” Quoth he, “Set down the basket from
thy head and fear naught, for all the treasure thou hast with thee
is thine, and none shall dispute it with thee.” So I set down the
crate before him, and he uncovered it and looked at it; then said
to me, “Tell me their case, albe I know it, as if I had been present
with you.” So I told him all that had passed and he said, “Thou
hast spoken the truth,” adding, “O Wardan, come now with me to
the treasure.” So I returned with him to the cavern, where he
found the trap-door closed and said to me, “O Wardan, lift it;
none but thou can open the treasure, for it is enchanted in thy
name and nature.”<a id="r435"></a><a href="#f435" class="c014"><sup>[435]</sup></a><a id="p296"></a> Said I, “By Allah, I cannot open it;” but
he said, “Go up to it, trusting in the blessing of Allah.” So I
called upon the name of Almighty Allah and, advancing to the
trap-door, put my hand to it; whereupon it came up as it had
been of the lightest. Then said the Caliph, “Go down and bring
hither what is there; for none but one of thy name and semblance
and nature hath gone down thither since the place was made, and
the slaying of the bear and the woman was appointed to be at thy
hand. This was chronicled with me and I was awaiting its fulfilment.”<a id="r436"></a><a href="#f436" class="c014"><sup>[436]</sup></a>
Accordingly (quoth Wardan) I went down and brought
<span class="pageno" id="Page_297">297</span>up all the treasure, whereupon the Caliph sent for beasts of burden
and carried it away, after giving me my crate, with what was
therein. So I bore it home and opened me a shop in the market.
“And” (saith he who telleth the tale) “this market is still
extant and is known as Wardan’s Market.” And I have heard
recount another story of</p>

  <h2 id="c297" class="c007">THE KING’S DAUGHTER AND THE APE.</h2>
</div>

<p class="c013">There was once a Sultan’s daughter, whose heart was taken with
love of a black slave: he abated her maidenhead and she became
passionately addicted to futtering, so that she could not do without
it a single hour and complained of her case to one of her body-women,
who told her that no thing poketh and stroketh more
abundantly than the baboon.<a id="r437"></a><a href="#f437" class="c014"><sup>[437]</sup></a> Now it so chanced one day, that
an ape-leader passed under her lattice, with a great ape; so she
unveiled her face and looking upon the ape, signed to him with her
eyes, whereupon he broke his bonds and chain and climbed up to
the Princess, who hid him in a place with her<a id="p297"></a>, and night and day
he abode there, eating and drinking and copulating. Her father
heard of this and would have killed her;——And Shahrazad perceived
the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say.</p>

<div>

<div class="nf-center-c1">
<div class="nf-center c005">
    <div>Now when it was the Three Hundred and Fifty-sixth Night,</div>
  </div>
</div>

</div>

<p class="c000">She said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that when the
Sultan heard of this work he would have slain his daughter; but
she smoked his design; and, disguising herself in Mameluke’s
dress, mounted horse after loading a mule with gold and bullion,
and precious stuffs past all account; then carrying with her the
ape, she fled to Cairo, where she took up her abode in one of the
houses without the city and upon the verge of the Suez-desert.
Now, every day, she used to buy meat of a young man, a butcher,
but she came not to him till after noonday; and then she was so
<span class="pageno" id="Page_298">298</span>yellow and disordered in face that he said in his mind, “There
must indeed hang some mystery by this slave.” Accordingly
(quoth the butcher) one day when she came to me as usual, I
went out after her secretly, and ceased not to follow her from place
to place, so as she saw me not, till she came to her lodging on the
edge of her waste and entered; and I looked in upon her through
a cranny, and saw her as soon as she was at home, kindle a fire
and cook the meat, of which she ate enough and served up the
rest to a baboon she had by her and he did the same. Then she
put off the slave’s habit and donned the richest of women’s apparel;
and so I knew that she was a lady. After this she set on wine
and drank and gave the ape to drink; and he stroked her nigh
half a score times without drawing till she swooned away, when he
spread over her a silken coverlet and returned to his place. Then
I went down in the midst of the place and the ape, becoming
aware of me, would have torn me in pieces; but I made haste to
pull out my knife and slit his paunch and his bowels fell out. The
noise aroused the young lady, who awoke terrified and trembling;
and, when she saw the ape in this case, she shrieked such a shriek
that her soul well nigh fled her body. Then she fell down in a
fainting-fit and when she came to herself, she said to me, “What
moved thee to do thus? Now Allah upon thee, send me after
him!” But I spoke her fair for a while and pledged myself to
stand in the ape’s stead in the matter of much poking, till her
trouble subsided and I took her to wife. But when I came to
perform my promise I proved a failure and I fell short in this
matter and could not endure such hard labour: so I complained
of my case and mentioned her exorbitant requirements to a certain
old woman who engaged to manage the affair and said to me,
“Needs must thou bring me a cooking-pot full of virgin vinegar
and a pound of the herb pellitory called wound-wort.”<a id="r438"></a><a href="#f438" class="c014"><sup>[438]</sup></a> So I
brought her what she sought, and she laid the pellitory in the pot
with the vinegar and set it on the fire, till it was thoroughly boiled.
Then she bade me futter the girl, and I futtered her till she fainted
away, when the old woman took her up (and she unconscious),
and set her parts to the mouth of the cooking-pot. The steam of
the pot entered her slit and there fell from it somewhat which I
<span class="pageno" id="Page_299">299</span>examined; and behold, it was two small worms, one black and
the other yellow. Quoth the old woman, “The black was bred
of the strokings of the negro and the yellow of stroking with the
baboon.” Now when she recovered from her swoon she abode
with me, in all delight and solace of life, and sought not swiving
as before, for Allah had done away from her this appetite; whereat
I marvelled——And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and
ceased saying her permitted say.</p>

<div class="nf-center c005">
    <div>Now when it was the Three Hundred and Fifty-seventh Night,</div>

</div>

<p class="c000">She said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that the young
man continued:—In truth Allah had done away from her this
appetite; whereat I marvelled and acquainted her with the case.
Thereupon I lived with her and she took the old woman to be to
her in the stead of her mother, “and” (said he who told me the tale)
“the old woman and the young man and his wife abode in joy and
cheer till there came to them the Destroyer of delights and the
Sunderer of societies; and glory be to the Ever-living One, who
dieth not and in whose hand is Dominion of the world visible and
invisible!”<a id="r439"></a><a href="#f439" class="c014"><sup>[439]</sup></a> And another tale they tell is that of</p>

<hr class="c015">

<div class="footnote" id="f437">
<p class="c000"><span class="label"><a href="#r437">437</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Arab. “Kird” (pron. in Egypt “Gird”). It is usually the hideous Abyssinian
cynocephalus which is tamed by the ape-leader popularly called Kuraydati (Lane, M. E.,
chapt. xx.). The beast has a natural penchant for women; I heard of one which
attempted to rape a girl in the public street and was prevented only by a sentinel’s
bayonet. They are powerful animals and bite like greyhounds.</p>
</div>

<div class="footnote" id="f438">
<p class="c000"><span class="label"><a href="#r438">438</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Easterns, attribute many complaints (such as toothache) to worms, visible as well as
microscopic; which may be held a fair prolepsis of the “germ-theory” the bacterium,
the bacillus, the microbe. Nymphomania, the disease alluded to in these two tales is
always attributed to worms in the vagina.</p>
</div>

<div class="footnote" id="f439">
<p class="c000"><span class="label"><a href="#r439">439</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Bestiality, very rare in Arabia is fatally common amongst those most debauched of
debauched races, the Egyptian proper and the Sindis. Hence the Pentateuch, whose
object was to breed a larger population of fighting men, made death the penalty for
lying with a beast (Deut. xxvii. 21). C. S. Sonnini (Travels, English translation, p. 663)
gives a curious account of Fellah lewdness. “The female crocodile during congress is
turned upon her back (?) and cannot rise without difficulty. Will it be believed that
there are men who take advantage of the helpless situation of the female, drive off the
male, and supplant him in this frightful intercourse? Horrible embraces, the knowledge
of which was wanting to complete the disgusting history of human perversity!” The
French traveller forgets to add the superstitious explanation of this congress which is
the sovereignest charm for rising to rank and riches. The Ajáib al-Hind tells a tale
(chapt. xxxix.) of a certain Mohammed bin Bullishad who had issue by a she-ape: the
young ones were hairless of body and wore quasi-human faces; and the father’s sight had
become dim by his bestial practice.</p>

of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project

performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
